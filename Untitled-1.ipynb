A plane graph G has a convex drawing if and only if G is internally triconnected. It has been known that an internally triconnected plane graph G of n vertices has a convex grid drawing on a grid of O(n 3) area if the triconnected component decomposition tree of G has at most four leaves. In this paper, we improve the area bound O(n 3) to O(n 2), which is optimal up to a constant factor. More precisely, we show that G has a convex grid drawing on a 2n脳4n grid. We also present an algorithm to find such a drawing in linear time.',\n",

A bandwidth consecutive multicoloring, simply called a b-coloring of G, assigns each vertex v a specified number b(v) of consecutive positive integers as colors of v so that, for each edge (v, w), all integers assigned to vertex v differ from all integers assigned to vertex w by more than b(v, w). The maximum integer assigned to vertices is called the span of the coloring. The b-coloring problem asks to find a b-coloring of a given graph G with the minimum span. In the paper, we present four efficient approximation algorithms for the problem, which have theoretical performance guarantees for the computation time, the span of a found b-coloring and the approximation ratio. We also obtain several upper bounds on the minimum span, expressed in terms of the maximum b-degrees, one of which is an extension of Brooks' theorem on an ordinary coloring.\",\n",

In this paper we show that the problem can be simply reduced to the edge-coloring problem in polynomial-time.

Each demand vertex v must be supplied an amount of \"power,\" equal to the demand of a, from exactly one supply vertex through edges in T. Each edge is assigned a positive number called the capacity. One wishes to partition T into subtrees by deleting edges from T so that each subtree contains exactly one supply vertex whose supply is no less than the sum of all demands in the subtree and the power flow through each edge is no more than capacity of the edge. The \"partition problem\" is a decision problem to ask whether T has such a partition. The \"maximum partition problem\" is an optimization version of the partition problem. In this paper, we give three algorithms for the problems. First is a linear-time algorithm for the partition problem. Second is a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the maximum partition problem.

In this paper we first introduce the notion of an Eulerian secret key exchange, in which the pairs of players sharing secret keys form an Eulerian circuit passing through all players. Along the Eulerian circuit any designated player can send a message to the rest of players and the message can be finally returned to the sender. Checking whether the returned message is the same as the original one, the sender can know whether the message circulation has been completed without any false alteration. We then give three efficient protocols to realize such an Eulerian secret key exchange. Each of the three protocols is optimal in a sense. The first protocol requires the minimum number of cards under a natural assumption that the same number of cards are dealt to each player. The second requires the minimum number of cards dealt to all players when one does not make the assumption. The third forms the shortest Eulerian circuit, and hence the time required to send the message to all players and acknowledge the secure receipt is minimum in this case.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A convex grid drawing of a plane graph G is a drawing of G on the plane such that all vertices of G are put on grid points, all edges are drawn as straight-line segments without any edge-intersection, and every face boundary is a convex polygon. In this paper we give a linear-time algorithm for finding a convex grid drawing of every 4-connected plane graph G with four or more vertices on the outer face. The size of the drawing satisfies W + H <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices of G, W is the width and H is the height of the grid drawing. Thus the area W center dot H is at most [(n - 1)/2] - [(n - 1)/2]. Our bounds on the sizes are optimal in a sense that there exist an infinite number of 4-connected plane graphs whose convex drawings need grids such that W + H = n - I and W center dot H = [(n - 1)/2] - [(n - 1)/2].',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Let G be a graph with a single source w, assigned a positive integer called the supply. Every vertex other than w is a sink, assigned a nonnegative integer called the demand. Every edge is assigned a positive integer called the capacity. Then a spanning tree T of G is called a spanning distribution tree if the capacity constraint holds when, for every sink v, an amount of flow, equal to the demand of v, is sent from w to v along the path in T between them. The spanning distribution tree problem asks whether a given graph has a spanning distribution tree or not. In the paper, we first observe that the problem is NP-complete even for series-parallel graphs, and then give a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem for a given series-parallel graph G. The computation time is bounded by a polynomial in n and D, where n is the number of vertices in G and D is the sum of all demands in G.',\n",

The algorithms find routing in two or three layers for two-terminal nets specified on the sides of a rectangle. All algorithms run in linear time. One of the three routing problems is the minimum area routing previously considered by LaPaugh and Gonzalez and Lee. The algorithms they developed run in time O( n 3 ) and O( n ) respectively. Our simple linear time algorithm is based on a theorem of Okamura and Seymour and on a data structure developed by Suzuki, Ishiguro and Nishizeki.',\n",

Previous results based on symmetric stable random projections(12, 16) required G = non-zero constant + O(ǫ), even when � = 0. The case � ! 0 is practically important. For example, � might be the \"decay rate\" or \"interest rate,\" which is usuall y small; and hence one might view skewed stable random projectionsas a \"generalized counter\" for estimating the total value in the future, taking in account of the effect of decaying or i nterest accruement. We consider the popular Turnstile data stream model. The input data stream at = (i, It) arriving sequentially describes the underlying signal A, meaning At(i) = At 1(i) + It, i 2 (1, D). We allow the increment It to be either positive (i.e., insertion) or negative (i.e., del etion). By definition, the αth frequency moment F(α) = PD i=1 |At(i)| α.
