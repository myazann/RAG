LESSEN answers cluster question\n113 (\u201cCan we develop human language technology (HLT) that allows us to communicate with our computers (smartphones, tablets)?\u201d)\nby making state-of-the-art chat-based AI technology available for the Dutch language, thereby allowing users to communicate with apps and services in a conversational manner, which is an increasingly popular medium for people to communicate with their computers and the services to which they provide access.\n2.1.2 Causes\nEconomic stakeholders in the Dutch ecosystem are keen to more autonomous position concerning the technology that they use to interact with their customers. For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021). For the (in-house) development of conversational AI, the key compute and data hindrances mentioned in Section 2.1.1 currently prevent progress.\nA (simplified) example from one of the co-funding partners in LESSEN (Albert Heijn) serves to illustrate the root causes.\nExample \u2013 Developing customer service assistants\nConversational assistants are built around so-called skills. A skill is a construct of one or more intents to fulfill a customer's request. So, for instance, Albert Heijn\u2019s order cancellation skill consists of several intents and actions to trigger:", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors. Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases.

The strong connection of the members of the consortium with European and International IR, NLP and ML communities will allow for scientific impact through advances produced by the project and establishing a community (by organizing workshops and tutorials) around low-resourced conversational agents and their safety and transparency. At the level of networks, the consortium (through the University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections) is well- connected to the ELLIS network (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems), which cover the ML angle. Through Leiden University, the University of Amsterdam and University of Groningen connections, the project is strongly embedded in the ACL community, which covers the NLP angle. And through its Leiden University, University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections the consortium has a pivotal in the SIGIR community, which covers the IR angle.

This provides an important avenue from output to outcome to impact. As results will be open sourced, there is also an avenue for co-funders who use a different technology stack.\nThe societal impact that LESSEN seeks to achieve is not limited to the co-funding partners in LESSEN, even though they will provide the most tangible proof points. LESSEN will seek additional and broader impact through its cooperating partners and through outreach activities.\n2.2.2 Assumptions\nLESSEN makes the following assumptions in its formulation of the societal impact (and its strategy for achieving that impact):\nAssumption 1: The economic stakeholders in LESSEN strive to a high degree of technological autonomy\nconcerning conversationally enabled applications;\nAssumption 2: There will be sufficient technological absorption capacity (in terms of data scientists and\nmachine learning engineers) at the side of the economic stakeholders in LESSEN to take on board the outcomes of LESSEN; and\nAssumption 3: Conversationally enabled applications will increasingly be data-driven.\nSuitability of Impact Plan approach", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors. Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4. Evaluation of the project progress will be done bi-annually in preparation of the plenary consortium meeting. Each research line leader is expected to deliver a short report on the progress during the past 6 months. Evaluation also plays an important role in the LESSEN research itself: the research methods will be evaluated intrinsically during the development and extrinsically in the context of applications at the stakeholders. WP4 outlines the evaluation-related activities planned during the project. \nScientific relevance\nWhat makes the LESSEN proposal challenging, original, and innovative can best be explained at three levels. First, we address key questions concerning efficiency of language and information retrieval technology, concerning (labeled) data bottlenecks, and concerning transparency of safety of language and information retrieval technology. Each of these questions has been earmarked as scientifically urgent in recent community-based vision documents. See, for instance, (ELLIS, 2021) for the first topic, (Hendrycks et al., 2021) for the second topic, and (Roegiest et al., 2019) for the third topic. Our research lines target these urgent topics head on.\nSecond, at the level of the research lines we make the following novel contributions:", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors.

Leiden University, Radboud University Nijmegen, and the University of Amsterdam have played, and continue to play, central roles in the IR evaluation communities and benchmarking activities (CLEF and TREC).\nThird, LESSEN\u2019s academic consortium members have earned significant international recognition from their respective communities so as to maximize the potential for scientific impact through their research, as evidenced by a broad range of leadership roles. De Rijke has played, and continues to play, leading roles in large-scale national and international initiatives in the space of LESSEN (including ICAI (NL), Algorithmic Decision Making + Society (AU), TRUC (US, NIST\u2019s new benchmarking initiative for trustworthy systems). Verberne, Kanoulas, and Hasibi are active leaders the IR community and are regularly asked to chair major IR conferences (e.g., Verberne is program chair for ECIR 2022, and Hasibi was general chair of ICTIR 2021). Fernandez and Bisazza were program co-chairs of CoNLL 2020 and 2021, respectively. Kanoulas is a leading organizer at evaluation fora such as CLEF, TREC, TAC, NTCIR, FIRE, SemEval, and TRECVid. Van Rijn is involved in the organization of meta-learning workshops and competitions, and is a leader in the OpenML community. We envision using our individual leadership roles in these communities to ensure that research outputs will be shared with fellow-researchers, to maximize LESSEN\u2019s scientific impact.\n6 Project overview\nProject structure and coherence", "See Annex 1A (on page 41) and 1B (on page 42).\nStrategic activity planning\na) Stakeholder engagement All co-funding stakeholder partners have been actively involved during the proposal writing stage, attending weekly meetings and providing input in the form of problem statements, examples, and requirements.

Methodology We will create a project handbook establishing the project\u2019s management and decision-making structure, internal communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and other procedures. Description of activities T7.1 (UvA) M1\u201360: Organizing regular meetings among partners and with the advisory board, as described in Section 6.4. T7.2 (UvA) M1\u201360: Monitoring the project progress requesting periodic progress reports from all partners every 6 months, and ensuring indicators (as listed in Annex 1B) are realized according to the set timelines. T7.3 (UvA) M1\u201360: Maintaining a risk registry, analyzing potential risks, and implementing corrective actions. T7.4 (UvA) M1\u201360: Reporting, both administrative and financial, ensuring the submission of project commitments. Beyond these, the task will propose to establish ad hoc working groups when appropriate to exploit emerging synergies, e.g., a working group on privacy-preserving machine learning, or qualitative methods. Productive interactions (co-design and co-creation) All partners will participate in T7.1, contribute to T7.2, potentially contribute to T7.3, and provide input to T7.4.

There will be close alignment with WP4, WP5, and WP6. Methodology We will create a project handbook establishing the project\u2019s management and decision-making structure, internal communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and other procedures. Description of activities T7.1 (UvA) M1\u201360: Organizing regular meetings among partners and with the advisory board, as described in Section 6.4. T7.2 (UvA) M1\u201360: Monitoring the project progress requesting periodic progress reports from all partners every 6 months, and ensuring indicators (as listed in Annex 1B) are realized according to the set timelines. T7.3 (UvA) M1\u201360: Maintaining a risk registry, analyzing potential risks, and implementing corrective actions. T7.4 (UvA) M1\u201360: Reporting, both administrative and financial, ensuring the submission of project commitments. Beyond these, the task will propose to establish ad hoc working groups when appropriate to exploit emerging synergies, e.g., a working group on privacy-preserving machine learning, or qualitative methods. Productive interactions (co-design and co-creation) All partners will participate in T7.1, contribute to T7.2, potentially contribute to T7.3, and provide input to T7.4.

It will also develop methods to improve the efficiency of data use and data re-use. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to train and fine-tune conversational AI models more efficiently and more effectively. Research line 2: Data adaptation and augmentation \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for lesser-resourced domain adaptation and data augmentation for conversationally enabled applications. The output of this research will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to extend conversational applications to new, lesser-resourced domains, tasks, and scenarios with very limited data budgets. Research line 3: Safety and transparency \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for safe selection and generation as well as for transparency and explainability of conversational applications. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to expose state-of-the-art conversational applications to end users (consumers) in a safe and responsible manner.", "See Annex 1A (on page 41) and 1B (on page 42).\nStrategic activity planning\na) Stakeholder engagement All co-funding stakeholder partners have been actively involved during the proposal writing stage, attending weekly meetings and providing input in the form of problem statements, examples, and requirements.

LESSEN answers cluster question\n113 (\u201cCan we develop human language technology (HLT) that allows us to communicate with our computers (smartphones, tablets)?\u201d)\nby making state-of-the-art chat-based AI technology available for the Dutch language, thereby allowing users to communicate with apps and services in a conversational manner, which is an increasingly popular medium for people to communicate with their computers and the services to which they provide access.\n2.1.2 Causes\nEconomic stakeholders in the Dutch ecosystem are keen to more autonomous position concerning the technology that they use to interact with their customers. For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021).

A skill is a construct of one or more intents to fulfill a customer's request. So, for instance, Albert Heijn\u2019s order cancellation skill consists of several intents and actions to trigger:\n\u2013 General welcome intent (\u2018Hi\u2019) \u2013 Main intent classification (\u2018cancel-order\u2019) \u2013 Ask to login (in case a customer is not authenticated yet) \u2013 Selection of correct order to cancel (\u2018Which of these orders do you want to cancel?\u2019) \u2013 Security question (\u2018Are you sure?\u2019) \u2013 Confirmation of cancellation \u2013 Question answered? Yes/No \u2013 If Yes: Goodbye and close case \u2013 If No: Hand over to human agent + expected waiting time Yes/No \u2013 If Yes: Remove handler and queue to a human agent \u2013 If No: Goodbye and close case\nThis set is triggered conditionally. Depending on, e.g., if the customer has already been authenticated or more specifically asks (e.g., \u2018I want to cancel my order to be delivered this Saturday\u2019), the assistant is able to set slots and skip parts of the conversation flow.\nDutch Research Agenda Research along routes by Consortia (NWA-ORC) 2020/21 Full proposal form IMPACT PLAN APPROACH\nPage 7\nEvery skill is built up like this. For each intent, developers produce a set of 200\u2013300 individual training phrases and about 50 test phrases. And for each main intent, developers typically set up 5 to 10 so-called stories that represent possible use cases and conversation flows. An additional layer of data needs comes from the fact that different consumer channels (web, phone, WhatsApp) require different setups and different responses. And yet another layer comes from the wish to cater for different dialects and regional variations. Furthermore, after a launching a new skill additional training data and stories are generated based on real-world conversations.", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors. Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4.

WP4 outlines the evaluation-related activities planned during the project. \nMore broadly, one of our methodological goals in LESSEN is to make sure the techniques we develop are grounded on real-world use cases due to the involvement of industrial partners with large user bases. In that sense, we will introduce new challenges and more realistic benchmarks for the research fields mentioned above.\nSecond, LESSEN\u2019s academic team members are well-positioned in their respective national and international communities and networks to evangelize the project\u2019s mission and scientific output. The strong connection of the members of the consortium with European and International IR, NLP and ML communities will allow for scientific impact through advances produced by the project and establishing a community (by organizing workshops and tutorials) around low-resourced conversational agents and their safety and transparency. At the level of networks, the consortium (through the University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections) is well- connected to the ELLIS network (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems), which cover the ML angle. Through Leiden University, the University of Amsterdam and University of Groningen connections, the project is strongly embedded in the ACL community, which covers the NLP angle. And through its Leiden University, University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections the consortium has a pivotal in the SIGIR community, which covers the IR angle. Through the University of Groningen and University of Amsterdam\nDutch Research Agenda Research along routes by Consortia (NWA-ORC) 2020/21 Full proposal form IMPACT PLAN APPROACH\nPage 19\nconnections, the consortium is also connected to the FAT* and BlackBoxNLP communities, which covers the responsible AI dimension.

Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4. Evaluation of the project progress will be done bi-annually in preparation of the plenary consortium meeting. Each research line leader is expected to deliver a short report on the progress during the past 6 months. Evaluation also plays an important role in the LESSEN research itself: the research methods will be evaluated intrinsically during the development and extrinsically in the context of applications at the stakeholders.

Leiden University, Radboud University Nijmegen, and the University of Amsterdam have played, and continue to play, central roles in the IR evaluation communities and benchmarking activities (CLEF and TREC).\nThird, LESSEN\u2019s academic consortium members have earned significant international recognition from their respective communities so as to maximize the potential for scientific impact through their research, as evidenced by a broad range of leadership roles. De Rijke has played, and continues to play, leading roles in large-scale national and international initiatives in the space of LESSEN (including ICAI (NL), Algorithmic Decision Making + Society (AU), TRUC (US, NIST\u2019s new benchmarking initiative for trustworthy systems). Verberne, Kanoulas, and Hasibi are active leaders the IR community and are regularly asked to chair major IR conferences (e.g., Verberne is program chair for ECIR 2022, and Hasibi was general chair of ICTIR 2021). Fernandez and Bisazza were program co-chairs of CoNLL 2020 and 2021, respectively. Kanoulas is a leading organizer at evaluation fora such as CLEF, TREC, TAC, NTCIR, FIRE, SemEval, and TRECVid. Van Rijn is involved in the organization of meta-learning workshops and competitions, and is a leader in the OpenML community. We envision using our individual leadership roles in these communities to ensure that research outputs will be shared with fellow-researchers, to maximize LESSEN\u2019s scientific impact.\n6 Project overview\nProject structure and coherence", "See Annex 1A (on page 41) and 1B (on page 42).\nStrategic activity planning\na) Stakeholder engagement All co-funding stakeholder partners have been actively involved during the proposal writing stage, attending weekly meetings and providing input in the form of problem statements, examples, and requirements.

It will also develop methods to improve the efficiency of data use and data re-use. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to train and fine-tune conversational AI models more efficiently and more effectively. Research line 2: Data adaptation and augmentation \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for lesser-resourced domain adaptation and data augmentation for conversationally enabled applications. The output of this research will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to extend conversational applications to new, lesser-resourced domains, tasks, and scenarios with very limited data budgets.

LESSEN answers cluster question\n113 (\u201cCan we develop human language technology (HLT) that allows us to communicate with our computers (smartphones, tablets)?\u201d)\nby making state-of-the-art chat-based AI technology available for the Dutch language, thereby allowing users to communicate with apps and services in a conversational manner, which is an increasingly popular medium for people to communicate with their computers and the services to which they provide access.\n2.1.2 Causes\nEconomic stakeholders in the Dutch ecosystem are keen to more autonomous position concerning the technology that they use to interact with their customers. For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021). For the (in-house) development of conversational AI, the key compute and data hindrances mentioned in Section 2.1.1 currently prevent progress.\nA (simplified) example from one of the co-funding partners in LESSEN (Albert Heijn) serves to illustrate the root causes.\nExample \u2013 Developing customer service assistants\nConversational assistants are built around so-called skills.

The strong connection of the members of the consortium with European and International IR, NLP and ML communities will allow for scientific impact through advances produced by the project and establishing a community (by organizing workshops and tutorials) around low-resourced conversational agents and their safety and transparency. At the level of networks, the consortium (through the University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections) is well- connected to the ELLIS network (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems), which cover the ML angle. Through Leiden University, the University of Amsterdam and University of Groningen connections, the project is strongly embedded in the ACL community, which covers the NLP angle.

See, for instance, (ELLIS, 2021) for the first topic, (Hendrycks et al., 2021) for the second topic, and (Roegiest et al., 2019) for the third topic. Our research lines target these urgent topics head on.\nSecond, at the level of the research lines we make the following novel contributions:", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors. Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4. Evaluation of the project progress will be done bi-annually in preparation of the plenary consortium meeting. Each research line leader is expected to deliver a short report on the progress during the past 6 months. Evaluation also plays an important role in the LESSEN research itself: the research methods will be evaluated intrinsically during the development and extrinsically in the context of applications at the stakeholders. WP4 outlines the evaluation-related activities planned during the project. \nLESSEN foresees multiple output-outcome-impact pathways (see Annex 1A) so as to maximize its potential for impact. As a technology provider, co-funding partner Rasa Technologies provides the platform on which Albert Heijn\u2019s conversational applications run. This provides an important avenue from output to outcome to impact. As results will be open sourced, there is also an avenue for co-funders who use a different technology stack.\nThe societal impact that LESSEN seeks to achieve is not limited to the co-funding partners in LESSEN, even though they will provide the most tangible proof points. LESSEN will seek additional and broader impact through its cooperating partners and through outreach activities.\n2.2.2 Assumptions\nLESSEN makes the following assumptions in its formulation of the societal impact (and its strategy for achieving that impact):\nAssumption 1: The economic stakeholders in LESSEN strive to a high degree of technological autonomy\nconcerning conversationally enabled applications;\nAssumption 2: There will be sufficient technological absorption capacity (in terms of data scientists and\nmachine learning engineers) at the side of the economic stakeholders in LESSEN to take on board the outcomes of LESSEN; and\nAssumption 3: Conversationally enabled applications will increasingly be data-driven.\nSuitability of Impact Plan approach", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors.

De Rijke has played, and continues to play, leading roles in large-scale national and international initiatives in the space of LESSEN (including ICAI (NL), Algorithmic Decision Making + Society (AU), TRUC (US, NIST\u2019s new benchmarking initiative for trustworthy systems). Verberne, Kanoulas, and Hasibi are active leaders the IR community and are regularly asked to chair major IR conferences (e.g., Verberne is program chair for ECIR 2022, and Hasibi was general chair of ICTIR 2021). Fernandez and Bisazza were program co-chairs of CoNLL 2020 and 2021, respectively. Kanoulas is a leading organizer at evaluation fora such as CLEF, TREC, TAC, NTCIR, FIRE, SemEval, and TRECVid. Van Rijn is involved in the organization of meta-learning workshops and competitions, and is a leader in the OpenML community.

Methodology We will create a project handbook establishing the project\u2019s management and decision-making structure, internal communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and other procedures. Description of activities T7.1 (UvA) M1\u201360: Organizing regular meetings among partners and with the advisory board, as described in Section 6.4. T7.2 (UvA) M1\u201360: Monitoring the project progress requesting periodic progress reports from all partners every 6 months, and ensuring indicators (as listed in Annex 1B) are realized according to the set timelines. T7.3 (UvA) M1\u201360: Maintaining a risk registry, analyzing potential risks, and implementing corrective actions. T7.4 (UvA) M1\u201360: Reporting, both administrative and financial, ensuring the submission of project commitments. Beyond these, the task will propose to establish ad hoc working groups when appropriate to exploit emerging synergies, e.g., a working group on privacy-preserving machine learning, or qualitative methods. Productive interactions (co-design and co-creation) All partners will participate in T7.1, contribute to T7.2, potentially contribute to T7.3, and provide input to T7.4.

There will be close alignment with WP4, WP5, and WP6. Methodology We will create a project handbook establishing the project\u2019s management and decision-making structure, internal communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and other procedures. Description of activities T7.1 (UvA) M1\u201360: Organizing regular meetings among partners and with the advisory board, as described in Section 6.4. T7.2 (UvA) M1\u201360: Monitoring the project progress requesting periodic progress reports from all partners every 6 months, and ensuring indicators (as listed in Annex 1B) are realized according to the set timelines. T7.3 (UvA) M1\u201360: Maintaining a risk registry, analyzing potential risks, and implementing corrective actions. T7.4 (UvA) M1\u201360: Reporting, both administrative and financial, ensuring the submission of project commitments. Beyond these, the task will propose to establish ad hoc working groups when appropriate to exploit emerging synergies, e.g., a working group on privacy-preserving machine learning, or qualitative methods. Productive interactions (co-design and co-creation) All partners will participate in T7.1, contribute to T7.2, potentially contribute to T7.3, and provide input to T7.4.

It will also develop methods to improve the efficiency of data use and data re-use. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to train and fine-tune conversational AI models more efficiently and more effectively. Research line 2: Data adaptation and augmentation \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for lesser-resourced domain adaptation and data augmentation for conversationally enabled applications. The output of this research will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to extend conversational applications to new, lesser-resourced domains, tasks, and scenarios with very limited data budgets. Research line 3: Safety and transparency \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for safe selection and generation as well as for transparency and explainability of conversational applications. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions.

A skill is a construct of one or more intents to fulfill a customer's request. So, for instance, Albert Heijn\u2019s order cancellation skill consists of several intents and actions to trigger:\n\u2013 General welcome intent (\u2018Hi\u2019) \u2013 Main intent classification (\u2018cancel-order\u2019) \u2013 Ask to login (in case a customer is not authenticated yet) \u2013 Selection of correct order to cancel (\u2018Which of these orders do you want to cancel?\u2019) \u2013 Security question (\u2018Are you sure?\u2019) \u2013 Confirmation of cancellation \u2013 Question answered? Yes/No \u2013 If Yes: Goodbye and close case \u2013 If No: Hand over to human agent + expected waiting time Yes/No \u2013 If Yes: Remove handler and queue to a human agent \u2013 If No: Goodbye and close case\nThis set is triggered conditionally. Depending on, e.g., if the customer has already been authenticated or more specifically asks (e.g., \u2018I want to cancel my order to be delivered this Saturday\u2019), the assistant is able to set slots and skip parts of the conversation flow.\nDutch Research Agenda Research along routes by Consortia (NWA-ORC) 2020/21 Full proposal form IMPACT PLAN APPROACH\nPage 7\nEvery skill is built up like this. For each intent, developers produce a set of 200\u2013300 individual training phrases and about 50 test phrases. And for each main intent, developers typically set up 5 to 10 so-called stories that represent possible use cases and conversation flows. An additional layer of data needs comes from the fact that different consumer channels (web, phone, WhatsApp) require different setups and different responses. And yet another layer comes from the wish to cater for different dialects and regional variations. Furthermore, after a launching a new skill additional training data and stories are generated based on real-world conversations.", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors.

This will allow a fair and holistic comparison against metrics such as performance, memory, training and inference time, training data needs, etc. Productive interactions (co-design and co-creation) The WP will collect from academic partners existing datasets and evaluation metrics appropriate for the goals of their research. Furthermore, we will collect, and synthesize the needs and wishes regarding new datasets and evaluation criteria that are not captured by the existing evaluation protocol. The industrial partners will be providing description of their industrial context, constraints, and criteria to be incorporated in the evaluation benchmarking. This will lead to a co-design of new benchmarks. Furthermore, industrial partners will provide their own industrial datasets to be cleaned and enriched according to the needs of the academic partners, and incorporated to the project evaluation platform, which will be used for the holistic evaluation of the developed algorithms.

Project outputs (cf. 4.1.3) are marked with (*).\nYear 1", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors. Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4. Evaluation of the project progress will be done bi-annually in preparation of the plenary consortium meeting. Each research line leader is expected to deliver a short report on the progress during the past 6 months. Evaluation also plays an important role in the LESSEN research itself: the research methods will be evaluated intrinsically during the development and extrinsically in the context of applications at the stakeholders. WP4 outlines the evaluation-related activities planned during the project. \n\u201cCreating value through responsible access to and use of big data.\u201d\nLESSEN enables economic stakeholders in the Netherlands to create value by giving them direct access to data and compute efficient conversational AI technology, subject to clear and actionable guidelines and guarantees concerning the safe and transparent use of such technology. LESSEN answers cluster question\n113 (\u201cCan we develop human language technology (HLT) that allows us to communicate with our computers (smartphones, tablets)?\u201d)\nby making state-of-the-art chat-based AI technology available for the Dutch language, thereby allowing users to communicate with apps and services in a conversational manner, which is an increasingly popular medium for people to communicate with their computers and the services to which they provide access.\n2.1.2 Causes\nEconomic stakeholders in the Dutch ecosystem are keen to more autonomous position concerning the technology that they use to interact with their customers. For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021). For the (in-house) development of conversational AI, the key compute and data hindrances mentioned in Section 2.1.1 currently prevent progress.\nA (simplified) example from one of the co-funding partners in LESSEN (Albert Heijn) serves to illustrate the root causes.\nExample \u2013 Developing customer service assistants\nConversational assistants are built around so-called skills. A skill is a construct of one or more intents to fulfill a customer's request. So, for instance, Albert Heijn\u2019s order cancellation skill consists of several intents and actions to trigger:", "Co-funding The participating co-funders (Achmea, Ahold Delhaize, Albert Heijn, KPN, Bol.com, Rasa) fully support LESSEN.

It will also develop methods to improve the efficiency of data use and data re-use. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to train and fine-tune conversational AI models more efficiently and more effectively. Research line 2: Data adaptation and augmentation \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for lesser-resourced domain adaptation and data augmentation for conversationally enabled applications. The output of this research will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to extend conversational applications to new, lesser-resourced domains, tasks, and scenarios with very limited data budgets. Research line 3: Safety and transparency \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for safe selection and generation as well as for transparency and explainability of conversational applications.

LESSEN answers cluster question\n113 (\u201cCan we develop human language technology (HLT) that allows us to communicate with our computers (smartphones, tablets)?\u201d)\nby making state-of-the-art chat-based AI technology available for the Dutch language, thereby allowing users to communicate with apps and services in a conversational manner, which is an increasingly popular medium for people to communicate with their computers and the services to which they provide access.\n2.1.2 Causes\nEconomic stakeholders in the Dutch ecosystem are keen to more autonomous position concerning the technology that they use to interact with their customers. For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021).

Each of these questions has been earmarked as scientifically urgent in recent community-based vision documents. See, for instance, (ELLIS, 2021) for the first topic, (Hendrycks et al., 2021) for the second topic, and (Roegiest et al., 2019) for the third topic.

Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4. Evaluation of the project progress will be done bi-annually in preparation of the plenary consortium meeting. Each research line leader is expected to deliver a short report on the progress during the past 6 months. Evaluation also plays an important role in the LESSEN research itself: the research methods will be evaluated intrinsically during the development and extrinsically in the context of applications at the stakeholders.

For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021). For the (in-house) development of conversational AI, the key compute and data hindrances mentioned in Section 2.1.1 currently prevent progress.\nA (simplified) example from one of the co-funding partners in LESSEN (Albert Heijn) serves to illustrate the root causes.\nExample \u2013 Developing customer service assistants\nConversational assistants are built around so-called skills. A skill is a construct of one or more intents to fulfill a customer's request.

De Rijke has played, and continues to play, leading roles in large-scale national and international initiatives in the space of LESSEN (including ICAI (NL), Algorithmic Decision Making + Society (AU), TRUC (US, NIST\u2019s new benchmarking initiative for trustworthy systems). Verberne, Kanoulas, and Hasibi are active leaders the IR community and are regularly asked to chair major IR conferences (e.g., Verberne is program chair for ECIR 2022, and Hasibi was general chair of ICTIR 2021). Fernandez and Bisazza were program co-chairs of CoNLL 2020 and 2021, respectively. Kanoulas is a leading organizer at evaluation fora such as CLEF, TREC, TAC, NTCIR, FIRE, SemEval, and TRECVid. Van Rijn is involved in the organization of meta-learning workshops and competitions, and is a leader in the OpenML community.

Project outputs (cf. 4.1.3) are marked with (*).\nYear 1", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors. Each PhD student and postdoc will also have a second supervisor from another academic partner in the consortium with whom they meet regularly as well (typically monthly). In addition, each of the academic institutions has its own evaluation and appraisal instrument for evaluating their PhD students and postdocs. Naturally, LESSEN will follow these practices. For monitoring and evaluating the individual work packages and their progress towards output (and hence outcomes), LESSEN will work with so-called canvases, in which key requirements, resources, people, and output and outcomes are detailed for the next phase of a PhD student or postdoc\u2019s research. Shared between academic and industrial stakeholders, these will form the basic instrument for continuous tracking of progress. Throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities to run pilot studies involving real end users at the industrial project partners for evaluating the developed technology will also be identified and pursed in the canvases. For monitoring at the level of work packages and research lines we follow the meeting structure as outlined in Section 6.4. Evaluation of the project progress will be done bi-annually in preparation of the plenary consortium meeting. Each research line leader is expected to deliver a short report on the progress during the past 6 months. Evaluation also plays an important role in the LESSEN research itself: the research methods will be evaluated intrinsically during the development and extrinsically in the context of applications at the stakeholders.

LESSEN answers cluster question\n113 (\u201cCan we develop human language technology (HLT) that allows us to communicate with our computers (smartphones, tablets)?\u201d)\nby making state-of-the-art chat-based AI technology available for the Dutch language, thereby allowing users to communicate with apps and services in a conversational manner, which is an increasingly popular medium for people to communicate with their computers and the services to which they provide access.\n2.1.2 Causes\nEconomic stakeholders in the Dutch ecosystem are keen to more autonomous position concerning the technology that they use to interact with their customers. For strategic (competitiveness) reasons, for economic reasons, and for legal reasons (so as not to share any potentially sensitive customer or company data with third parties), EU economic stakeholders, in general, and Dutch economic stakeholders, in particular, are seeking to build in-house capabilities and capacity in key areas (Timmer, 2021). For the (in-house) development of conversational AI, the key compute and data hindrances mentioned in Section 2.1.1 currently prevent progress.\nA (simplified) example from one of the co-funding partners in LESSEN (Albert Heijn) serves to illustrate the root causes.\nExample \u2013 Developing customer service assistants\nConversational assistants are built around so-called skills.

In that sense, we will introduce new challenges and more realistic benchmarks for the research fields mentioned above.\nSecond, LESSEN\u2019s academic team members are well-positioned in their respective national and international communities and networks to evangelize the project\u2019s mission and scientific output. The strong connection of the members of the consortium with European and International IR, NLP and ML communities will allow for scientific impact through advances produced by the project and establishing a community (by organizing workshops and tutorials) around low-resourced conversational agents and their safety and transparency. At the level of networks, the consortium (through the University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections) is well- connected to the ELLIS network (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems), which cover the ML angle. Through Leiden University, the University of Amsterdam and University of Groningen connections, the project is strongly embedded in the ACL community, which covers the NLP angle. And through its Leiden University, University of Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen connections the consortium has a pivotal in the SIGIR community, which covers the IR angle.

WP4 outlines the evaluation-related activities planned during the project. \nLESSEN foresees multiple output-outcome-impact pathways (see Annex 1A) so as to maximize its potential for impact. As a technology provider, co-funding partner Rasa Technologies provides the platform on which Albert Heijn\u2019s conversational applications run. This provides an important avenue from output to outcome to impact. As results will be open sourced, there is also an avenue for co-funders who use a different technology stack.\nThe societal impact that LESSEN seeks to achieve is not limited to the co-funding partners in LESSEN, even though they will provide the most tangible proof points. LESSEN will seek additional and broader impact through its cooperating partners and through outreach activities.\n2.2.2 Assumptions\nLESSEN makes the following assumptions in its formulation of the societal impact (and its strategy for achieving that impact):\nAssumption 1: The economic stakeholders in LESSEN strive to a high degree of technological autonomy\nconcerning conversationally enabled applications;\nAssumption 2: There will be sufficient technological absorption capacity (in terms of data scientists and\nmachine learning engineers) at the side of the economic stakeholders in LESSEN to take on board the outcomes of LESSEN; and\nAssumption 3: Conversationally enabled applications will increasingly be data-driven.\nSuitability of Impact Plan approach", "For monitoring progress of individual PhD students and postdoc, they will have weekly meetings with their first supervisors.

Methodology We will create a project handbook establishing the project\u2019s management and decision-making structure, internal communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and other procedures. Description of activities T7.1 (UvA) M1\u201360: Organizing regular meetings among partners and with the advisory board, as described in Section 6.4. T7.2 (UvA) M1\u201360: Monitoring the project progress requesting periodic progress reports from all partners every 6 months, and ensuring indicators (as listed in Annex 1B) are realized according to the set timelines. T7.3 (UvA) M1\u201360: Maintaining a risk registry, analyzing potential risks, and implementing corrective actions. T7.4 (UvA) M1\u201360: Reporting, both administrative and financial, ensuring the submission of project commitments. Beyond these, the task will propose to establish ad hoc working groups when appropriate to exploit emerging synergies, e.g., a working group on privacy-preserving machine learning, or qualitative methods.

There will be close alignment with WP4, WP5, and WP6. Methodology We will create a project handbook establishing the project\u2019s management and decision-making structure, internal communication channels, dispute resolution mechanisms, and other procedures. Description of activities T7.1 (UvA) M1\u201360: Organizing regular meetings among partners and with the advisory board, as described in Section 6.4. T7.2 (UvA) M1\u201360: Monitoring the project progress requesting periodic progress reports from all partners every 6 months, and ensuring indicators (as listed in Annex 1B) are realized according to the set timelines. T7.3 (UvA) M1\u201360: Maintaining a risk registry, analyzing potential risks, and implementing corrective actions. T7.4 (UvA) M1\u201360: Reporting, both administrative and financial, ensuring the submission of project commitments. Beyond these, the task will propose to establish ad hoc working groups when appropriate to exploit emerging synergies, e.g., a working group on privacy-preserving machine learning, or qualitative methods. Productive interactions (co-design and co-creation) All partners will participate in T7.1, contribute to T7.2, potentially contribute to T7.3, and provide input to T7.4.

It will also develop methods to improve the efficiency of data use and data re-use. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to train and fine-tune conversational AI models more efficiently and more effectively. Research line 2: Data adaptation and augmentation \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for lesser-resourced domain adaptation and data augmentation for conversationally enabled applications. The output of this research will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to extend conversational applications to new, lesser-resourced domains, tasks, and scenarios with very limited data budgets. Research line 3: Safety and transparency \u2013 This line will develop algorithms for safe selection and generation as well as for transparency and explainability of conversational applications. The output of this research line will consist of algorithmic solutions. Prototype implementations, validated on both public and proprietary datasets will lead to outcomes where the economic stakeholders in LESSEN are able to expose state-of-the-art conversational applications to end users (consumers) in a safe and responsible manner.", "See Annex 1A (on page 41) and 1B (on page 42).\nStrategic activity planning\na) Stakeholder engagement All co-funding stakeholder partners have been actively involved during the proposal writing stage, attending weekly meetings and providing input in the form of problem statements, examples, and requirements.
