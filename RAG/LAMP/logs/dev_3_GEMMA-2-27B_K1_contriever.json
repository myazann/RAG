As for those who think the series is overly explicit, I disagree, romantic scenes are well and tastefully written.  My property is surrounded by Amish farms and I did find what I thought were errors in some descriptions of customs but it is entirely possible the author is familiar with a very different sect of Amish, so I may be wrong.  Though I cannot imagine any group of Amish planning for a wedding in June at the height of farming season, in my area weddings are on Thursday in October, well after planting and harvesting season.

I liked Damien. He was once a rich noble whose father dies with excessive debts. He did everything he had to do to pay off his fathers debts. That includes working the land and doing jobs hired help and servants do. He also doesnt have very many servants. He had one servant who was his mothers maid when she was alive. She became his wife's maid and also his kids governess. Then when his wife died she also took up being housekeeper and cook, when he lost servants because his brother-in-law (Lord Poole) spread bad rumors about him. The lady couldn't cook and didn't do a lot of house work, but he kept her because she was loyal and took care of the kids. Isabella was also a great character. She put up with an abusive step father, then an abusive grandfather and Great Aunt, then decided she was better off on her own so found a job, and became a working woman. She made her own way and did not complaint about things. She was level headed and nice.\n\nIt was easy enough to figure out who Isabella's father was or at least what family he came from. There are also a couple of things that do not make sense or aren't explained. They did not bother me, but if you are one of these people that have to have everything perfect, it is not for you. The main one for me is Damien's first wife's death. Why did her horse come back without her, and her glove, hat and handkerchief found in the lake, so they assumed she drown, when her body was found somewhere else she couldn't have ridden to. You have to assume she staged her death, but why would she have staged her death when she had not found the thing she needed to be able to survive. Her death was obviously an accident, but even if she had narrowed it down to a place where she though it was, how did she know someone did not find it before and took off with it. I would think she would find it first, if she was that close, and then staged her death. She could have avoided the person she wanted to get away from a little longer until she was sure.\n\nI like her writing. This is my third book of hers that I have read. So far I like 'How to Be a Scottish Mistress' best. Waiting for the next book related to that which comes out in 4 days called 'Bride of a Scottish Warrior'. Even though sometimes I enjoy the conflict when couples fight, the 3 books I have read of hers, the couples do not really fight, and they know they fell strongly for the other person, even if they don't think they are in love.  It is usually more of a sweet love.\n\nSex content medium. A couple of scenes.

Two young men, after reading Nietsche and speculating on their own world-shaking intellects, decide to commit the perfect murder--a thrill kill.  They kidnap a young boy, murder him, dispose of the corpse, then toy with the police to lead them in the wrong direction and indulge their egos.\n\nOf course, it all goes wrong...otherwise there would have never been a trial, books and movies.  The killers are tied in the cord of their own 'brilliance.'\n\nThis film, in fact, is two films rolled into one.  The first, and to my way of thinking the most interesting, film is the first...the story of the crime and the two murderers.  The second film starts abruptly on the arrest of the killers.  Orson Wells enters the movie as the ponderous, anti-capital punishment, defense attorney [Clarence Darrow in real life].  After first pleading 'Not Guilty', then observing the faces of the jurers, he abruptly changes the verdict to 'Guilty, with Mitigating Circumstances.'  This means that the jury must be removed and the case tried by only the judge.\n\nOn the other hand, should Darrow aruge an 'Insanity' Defense, a jury must again be empanelled.  Nevertheless, Darrow brings 'experts' to the stand who testify that the killers are mentally deranged and one killer is diagnosed as 'schizophrenic'.  Somehow the judge lets all these shenanigans stand [remember Judge Ito?] so, despite the bias of the movie/directors/producers/writers, we know the bias of the judge.  He WILL return life imprisonment verdicts i.e. no capital punishment.  Nevertheless, Darrow goes on to passionately argue the immorality of capital punishment...and...might I say, his speeches are impressive.\n\nStill I downgraded this otherwise excellent movie from 5 to 4 stars because this is a film with a heavy-handed message, which is just another word for bias, prejudice and propaganda.  In that I am thoroughly sick of high school-dropout film makers preaching to the rest of the rest of us, I downgraded this one star and maybe should have downgraded it more.\n\nSo what is the 'message' and propaganda?  It's the same as Capote's 'In Cold Blood'.  No matter how heinous a crime, the death verdict is NEVER justified.  Why?  Because, ultimately, no one is really, REALLY, responsible for his/her actions.  The fault is that of mothers, fathers, society and/or environment.  Afterall, anyone who does anything awful can't be sane....can he?  If he's not sane, how can we execute him?\n\nBut I would turn this argument inside out.  If we...in an ultimate sense...are not responsible, how can we put ANYONE in prison?  Truly, it's not really a question of the death penalty, it's a matter of punishment.  If we aren't responsible, how is it possible that we can be punished?  Isn't it immoral?  Personally, I don't know, but do know this:  A society...any society...that acts as if the individual bears no responsibility, is finished.\n\nRon Braithwaite, author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Most memorable are the Peter Lorre character, the police commissioner and the miserable old pawn broker.  Lorre's complex character deserves careful dissection.  He lives in abject poverty but, with the help of his poor mother, manages to graduate with high honors with a degree in criminology.  His future--and the future of his family--should be guaranteed except for the fact that our 'hero' is idiosyncratic to the point of deep pathology.  He has a schizoid personality disorder characterized, in part, by truly incredible arrogance and delusions of grandeur.  He commits a murder which is almost a 'thrill kill.'  He thinks he can commit the perfect crime because he is far more intelligent than the police.\n\nHere is where I think the film is misdirected.  It should have, in my opinion, been a study of the unrelenting power of a guilty conscience.  The character should have behaved rather intelligently and coolly until 'done in' by his own guilty soul.  Instead the director produces a character who is so peculiar, weird and unlikeable that he draws attention to himself.  His guilt is a neon sign.  Not just once but over and over.  Ultimately he leaves no room for himself.  Everybody knows he is guilty.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.6}, {"id": "2127", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nMovie fast moving, good as I first saw it in theater or on TV - can't remember which.

Where the first book was a tragic story with a tight focus on one community, this book is about terror on a larger scale.  Like a lot of good plague/infection tales, it features the accelerating decline of a community through the lens of several families; after all, it is the individualized family unit that denotes civilization and separates humans from the herd/pack mentality of animals.  What makes this book different is that the source of the infection isn't a biological weapon or a zombie plague or anything cooked up in a laboratory, but rather an ancient (and somewhat ambiguous) evil unearthed in the nearby forest.\n\nAs the evil spreads, turning ordinary citizens into ruthless killers, we see the rest of the townsfolk band together or pull apart as all of their seething resentments and unspoken emotions are forced to the surface because of the mounting crisis.  By the time the book reaches its final conclusion with suggestions that the plague has begun to spread much father than this small community, no one in town is untouched by the carnage and rampant conflict around them.\n\nThis book is a fun read and has enough suspense to keep the reader interested; however, I don't think this book is as successful as THE KEEPER.  The evil in the woods that is the source of the novel's conflict is never fully explored or explained enough to really have a sense of its origin or purpose.  Also, the ease with which it is released and the speed with which it engulfs not only this town but also, presumably, the world is a bit unbelievable - what has kept it in containment so long if it is so easily released?  Still, fans of Langan or of any good novel about the deterioration of \"civilized\" society will not go away disappointed.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I've read a couple of Anne Rice books (though the first book of her Mayfair Witches series captured me more than Lestat ever did) and seen a few fang movies; the onslaught of vampire drivel that's out there now (especially that overhyped and underwritten Mormon abstinence parable masquerading as teen romance) has done very little to sway my opinion.  Therefore, I approached Cronin's The Passage with understandable trepidation.  Could this new vampire menace really be that much different than all the others?  Well, as long as they didn't sparkle in the sun like diamonds I figured I could at least give it a try...\n\nIt only took me a few pages to get hooked on this almost unclassifiable story.  Yes, it's a horror novel, and the horror is there by the bucketful, but the horror dished out by Cronin's nouveau vampires is no worse than the horror humans do to one another (this is nothing new for readers of dystopian literature, but it bears repeating).  What surprised me the most was that between moments of bloodshed, this book read like a literary novel...and a good one at that.  Perhaps I'm jaded, but with a few rare exceptions I have to get my fixes for horror/suspence and finely-crafted storytelling in very different places.  This book, I am happy to say, is one of those rare exceptions.\n\n[SMALL SPOILER AHEAD!]\n\nWhat I was most compelled by was the way that the story transformed.  After spending a good portion of the story with Amy and her kidnapper/protector/father figure and other characters related to that time period, the book swiftly and effortlessly shifts forward almost a century into the future (with divider notes that suggest a future even further beyond that) where civilization has broken down after the viral plague.  Here we meet new characters who must contend with these manmade monsters and create lives for themselves within heavily fortified walls.  When this new story finally comes back into contact with the former story through the arrival of Amy (not like the other virals but no longer entirely human), the novel takes a dramatic turn that once again upsets the \"natural order\" of the world and catapaults the characters toward their destinies.\n\nMy one complaint with the book is that the author is far too fond of ending chapters with \"cliffhangers\" that seem to indicate certain doom for one or more of the beloved characters, and then returning to the situation with an almost unbelievable conclusion that puts everything back to rights.  After a while, this overused device takes a little of the suspenseful sting out of these events...why worry if you can be fairly certain that all will be right with the world?  Luckily the author delivers enough surprises (and carnage) to keep readers from fully growing complacent, and the cliffhangers at the end of the novel will have readers impatiently awaiting the next installment.  Let's just hope that Cronin can deliver his sequels on a schedule more in line with the horror writer inside of him rather than the literary author.

Rated 4.5 of 5\n\n<em>Unsold Television Pilots 1955-1989</em> is an expanded version of author Lee Goldberg's book <em>The Best TV Shows That Never Were</em> (reviewed yesterday).  Yesterday's book focused on, as the title suggests, the best shows that were never made.  This book is ALL the shows not made between 1955-1989.  It is not a simple read.  But it is fascinating!\n\nThis is a great peek at how Hollywood thinks.  Compare the shows that made it to these shows that didn't even get past the pilot stage, and you can start to see what the Hollywood TV makers think of the television consumer.  But you can also look at some of these pilots and wonder what the heck ever made anyone think it might be a good idea.\n\nThe book is broken down into chronological order by year and within each year it is broken down by studio and type (comedy or drama).  There is a comprehensive list of producers, writers, and actors along with the general story plot for the pilot.  In some cases the intended story arc for the potential series is also presented.\n\nFor those of us with a fascination with television history, this is a gold mine.  Whether it's seeing actor names like Harrison Ford in a pilot where James Farentino plays a defrocked priest (<em>The Possessed</em>, 1977) or Dwayne Hickman is the only male teacher in an elementary school (<em>Hey Teacher</em>, 1964); or writers like Earl Hamner (<em>The Waltons</em>) come up with ideas like that in which young veterinarians live in the mountains with a huge tiger and a pair of orangutans (<em>Tiger, Tiger</em>, 1969), this book is filled with little gems.\n\nAlthough I read this chronologically, cover to cover, this is easily the sort of book that one could pick up and thumb through and look at any year. Any producer.\n\nThough it has little useful information for daily use, for those of us who love trivia and pop culture and television, this book has so much to offer.\n\nThe down side is that it only goes up to 1989.  An entire generation (or even two) of television watchers won't see the failed pilots from their viewing years.  But I can understand how much more difficult it gets as more and more networks begin producing their own shows.  And with companies such as Amazon and Netflix also making original programming, just keeping track of these things becomes more and more complicated.\n\nThis book is clearly a labor of love by author Lee Goldberg.  That he is a fan of the business, as well as an insider, is obvious.  I would like to have seen a little stronger hand in the proof-reading.  I recognize that there are a LOT of names in this 800+ page book, but there were times when the errors (not all of them typos) seemed a little too much.  <em>Stor Trek</em> instead of <em>Star Trek</em> is an example, and in a 1979 inclusion of The Return of the Mod Squad, character of Lincoln ('Linc\") Hayes is twice referred to as \"Line\" Hayes.  Note that my copy of the book was an advance reading copy and that perhaps some corrections were made before publishing.\n\nAll in all, I really like this book and will most certainly reference it in the future.\n\nLooking for a good book? <em>Unsold Television Pilots: 1955-1989</em> by Lee Goldberg is a great look at pop history from a point of view that we don't often see ... the things that don't make it to the public eye.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Rated 3.75 of 5\n\nAlthough I love to read, and I read a lot, I grew up a child of the television age.  As one of those first generation 'latch-key' kid, the television was my nanny.  And when I moved to Hollywood, it was television that I had hoped to break in to.  I am also one of those individuals who has a number of somewhat obscure television references books (and have had for probably thirty years now).  And so, this is precisely the sort of book that I really, really like.\n\n<em>Television Fast Forward</em> is a reference book about the \"Sequels and Remakes of Cancelled Series\" from 1955 to 1992.\n\nWe all know, and probably comment on the fact that Hollywood doesn't ever come up with anything new, but instead just resurrects old shows..  But do you have any idea just how many old series' really are brought back to life on the screen?  This is the book to fill you in.  I'm fairly savvy about television, even if it's a show I've never watched myself, I often know about it and all its incarnations (thank you obscure reference books!).  But even so, I picked up on a few things that were new to me here. (For instance [just one of many], I never knew that there was an un-aired pilot made from <em>The Greatest American Hero</em>, called <em>The Greatest American Heroine</em>.)\n\nBecause I am a little strange and will even read a reference book cover to cover, I also picked up on some small tidbits.  For instance...I never knew that Warren Zevon did music for a television show (a 1993 remake of <em>Route 66</em>) or that Sandra Bullock appeared in a 1989 movie called <em>The Bionic Showdown</em> - a sequel to <em>The Six Million Dollar Man</em> and <em>The Bionic Woman</em> (one of four sequels).\n\nThere are a couple of things that I didn't like about this book.\n\n1) This book was originally released in 1992 and all the sequel/remake information only is complete to that point.  At the end of the book there is an appendix of \"Television Series Revivals 1992-2015\" which lists the television shows, but doesn't give any of the fantastic background information that Goldberg provides for the older shows.  There is also an appendix \"Television Series Remakes 1992-2015\" which is the same - just a list with no background.  Although the Star Trek section does include the J.J. Abrams first 'reboot' movie\n\n2) I recognize that what I have is an Advanced Reader Copy, but the number of spelling, typography, and simple proof-reading errors was disappointing.  One would hope that if this was published in 1992, any errors from that publication would have been corrected and that there should not be new errors in the old copy.  But we have, about Star Trek, the sentence that it was \"just about arty story could be told\" (sic) and its creator was Gene Rodden berry (sic).\n\nBut still, this is precisely the sort of book that I want on my bookshelf (not on my kindle) so that I can refer to it periodically.  If you are a fan of television, you'll want this, too!\n\nLooking for a good book?

When last seen, Hal had heroically sacrificed himself re-igniting the sun to save the DC Universe in \"The Final Night.\"  In 1999, DC Comics had writer Geoff Johns bring Hal back from purgatory for more in \"Day of Judgment,\" as the Justice League teams with the Sentinels of Magic (Zatanna, Dr. Fate, the Phantom Stranger, the Golden Age Green Lantern, etc.) to thwart mystical underworld villain Nekron.\n\nDisposing of the Spectre's previous host, Jim Corrigan, \"Day of Judgment\" sets up Hal's slow road to redemption, as he becomes the new Spectre (with a Green Lantern-like appearance).  DC wisely recognized turning Hal back into Green Lantern full-time (after his numerous misdeeds) shouldn't happen too quickly, so that is how/why \"Day of Judgment\" is set up.  At best, it is a nice yet otherwise forgettable bridge towards Johns' far superior \"Green Lantern - Rebirth\" in 2005.  With an included back-up feature, this trade paperback is also a solid piece showcasing Zatanna, Alan Scott (the Golden Age Green Lantern), and the other Sentinels of Magic (a far-less-grim forerunner to today's Justice League Dark).\n\nThe major detriment really is the amateurish artwork, ranging from okay to mediocre to atrocious - in other words, it is consistent with DC Comics' declining efforts during the late `90's.  The sole terrific image is of a cover close-up of a ghostly pale Hal.\n\nUltimately, if you like Hal Jordan as much as Geoff Johns obviously does, this is a decent adult read.  Far better, adult-appropriate Geoff Johns storylines starring Hal Jordan (as Green Lantern) would be the superb \"Green Lantern - Rebirth\" and even the shockingly gory \"Blackest Night.\"\n\nRating: a weak 3/5 stars.

At the time, Harrison Ford (circa 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back\") was my perfect choice for Green Lantern's live-action movie adaptation.  In June 2011, Warner Bros. & DC Comics finally release a Green Lantern film, leaving audiences to settle for Ryan Reynolds as the title character.  Of available actors, either he or, better yet, Chris Pine were arguably the best known options.  Reynolds subsequently fails to impress in an estimated $300 million production (upon factoring in all the promotional costs).  His shallow efforts are further deep-sixed by an awful script and gaudy CGI special effects imbuing this vastly disappointing film with all the aura of an overblown video game.\n\nDirector Martin Campbell seemed a logical, slam-bang choice to initiate \"Green Lantern\" into a super-hero film franchise.  Having seen his high octane efforts reviving Zorro (with Antonio Banderas & Catherine Zeta-Jones) and James Bond twice (with Pierce Brosnan and later Daniel Craig), Campbell normally has a knack of capturing sleek, inspired performances from his actors.  This time, though, Campbell's cast  offers a collective sleepwalking job, as I've seen Green Lantern cartoons with better acting.  Additional sabotage comes from this movie's lackluster script incoherently blending elements from various Green Lantern storylines, which leaves its target PG-13 audience to only undemanding viewers in the 12-25 crowd.\n\nThe film immediately stumbles into a \"Battlestar Galactica\"-like voice-over prologue by explaining far too much too soon.  Eerily enough, actor Geoffrey Rush's voice-over even mimics Patrick Macnee's voice from \"Galactica.\"  Without revealing crucial spoilers, the filmmakers should have saved vital revelations about planet Oa's existence and the Green Lantern Corps for a proposed sequel.  There wasn't enough screen time to sufficiently develop Parallax, Hector Hammond, and even Sinestro into villains all in one film.  Although the game plan was to set up the franchise with an awesome Green Lantern vs. Sinestro sequel, the combination of such a crummy script with an over-abundance of obviously fake CGI makes for a dreadful viewing experience.  If the film had plausibly focused on a raw, mysterious origin (where rookie Hal desperately believes he is the only Green Lantern vs. imminent cosmic destruction), the end result could have been immensely better.  In fairness, the movie's best asset is the inclusion of reliable actors in various supporting roles: i.e. the late Michael Clarke Duncan, Geoffrey Rush, Clancy Brown, Angela Bassett, Jay O. Sanders, Jon Tenney, and Tim Robbins.  Unfortunately, the mind-numbing plot gives them familiar characters (i.e. Kilowog, Tomar-Re, Amanda Waller, Abin Sur, and the Jordan family) with so little to do.\n\nThis film's worst offense, ultimately, is its flagrant pushing of CGI to hide how crummy the movie really is.  Case in point: the ultra-fake opening sequence depicting outer space is flat-out laughable.  An immediate sense that this movie is in deep trouble continues as even Hal & Carol's jets flying over the California desert is just another helping of CGI.  Utilizing some models (or even recycling stock footage of real \"Top Gun\" jets) would have been far more credible.  It doesn't take long before viewers will realize they are watching actors lazily going through the green-screen motions, treating \"Green Lantern\" merely as a paycheck movie.  As this cast carelessly fails to sell viewers on suspending total disbelief, the film's over-reliance on CGI becomes sadly apparent.  Hence, the film squanders an enormous optical effects budget resulting in nothing more real than an emerald fireworks show.\n\nConsidering the insane amount of money Warner Bros already lost on this movie, the planned 2020 reboot makes sense, provided there are four HUGE conditions:  1. Hire a compatible director (someone who actually grasps why a fearless Hal Jordan (or John Stewart) is Green Lantern; 2. Get the right Hal (perhaps Garrett Hedlund) or John (maybe Michael Jai White); 3.  The cast must provide inspired, high-caliber efforts; and 4. Far more attention is focused on an intelligent script first rather than simply gambling it all on CGI.\n\nI lucked out skipping the theater experience by later finding the blu-ray at a cheap price.  If only once, my young son and I could be kids together gleefully seeing my favorite childhood super-hero come to life.  I just wish this \"Green Lantern\" film had met more than just a fraction of its vast potential.  Instead, \"Green Lantern\" is really a second coming of Ben Affleck's dreadful 2003 Daredevil movie (including Reynolds' smug, Affleck-like performance).\n\nRating: 4/10 (Updated in August 2015).\n\nNote: There are two gruesome scenes inside a secret laboratory in the film's second half that I would advise not letting children see -- parents will know when they watch the film.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n\n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 2.5}, {"id": "2148", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nwas another great book, can't believe I have all the books and I'm still wanting more!\nthank you melody Anne!\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

For its time, it was also unique in that the female lead was treated somewhat as an equal with her other male colleagues which we take for granted today but was unheard of in 1940.  As far as screwball comedies go, I wouldn't call this the best one I've seen as that accolade would have to go to \"My Man Godfrey\" or perhaps \"The Thin Man\" but this movie while not coming close to the standard of these two is still entertaining.\n\nThe problem with this DVD though is the poor video quality although the sound quality isn't that bad if you have a system with Dolby Pro Logic which simulates surround sound and yet the hissing is still noticeable.  The picture quality is riddled with imperfections and it may be a good idea to wait for a properly restored version to come out or maybe Blu-Ray?  The Biography - Cary Grant On Film was entertaining but it isn't the best biopic on the man that I've seen.  For that you would have to see the special features for the 2-Disc version of \"Bringing Up Baby\" which by the way is also a much better movie than this one.  The jokes on \"His Girl Friday\" while they may have been funny 68 years ago have not aged very well and despite the quick dialogue, I guess living in this extremely fast paced society today, I didn't think it was that extraordinary either.  Believe me people in Singapore speak just as fast or even faster as a matter of course.  As far as screwball comedy with jokes that are still funny today go, I'd recommend \"My Man Godfrey\", \"The Thin Man\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\" ahead of this one and in that order.  By the way, the Tony Curtis intro does nothing for the disc and I'm not sure what exactly his input had to do with improving the overall enjoyment of the disc as it clearly didn't do that.\n\nShort on special features, okay sound but poor picture quality on humour material that doesn't age well makes me recommend you give this DVD a miss.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Firstly, the jokes are more frequent and are less dated sounding and I found myself laughing at them although I was born more than 3 decades later and overall \"The Thin Man\" moves along at a good pace making it for me the true Best Picture of 1934.  Woody Van Dyke was also the better director although I can see how the screenplay award could go down to the wire.\n\nAs the second best movie of 1934, this movie has a few good things going for it although to call it the best ever screwball romantic comedy would be ridiculous as there are many better ones such as \"My Girl Friday\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\" just to name a couple let alone \"The Thin Man\", as it does have a pretty good screenplay and both Gable and Claudette have a good on-screen chemistry.  I thought the film dragged on a little though and was not as smooth flowing as say \"The Thin Man\" and the \"logic\" of going on foot instead of continuing on the bus and in not telling Ellie why he had to go and get gas in the middle of the night escapes me but what made this film great is the great acting of both Gable and Claudette who both deserved their Oscars although I can see why Bette Davis would feel aggrieved after her great performance in \"Of Human Bondage\".\n\nThe problem with this DVD though is the very poor sound and visual quality of the transfer when compared with \"The Thin Man\".  Perhaps the original masters were better preserved for the latter film but the difference in quality is night and day if you can get a copy of the DVDs to compare them you'll see what I mean.  A little known fact about this movie though is that the scene on the cover is what inspired the creation of Bugs Bunny as creator Chuck Jones stated that he saw Gable as a \"big rabbit\" and if you watch early Bugs Bunny cartoons, you'll see more than a slight resemblance to Peter Warne as portrayed in the movie.\n\nTo conclude, good movie but poor DVD transfer and certainly NOT the best picture of 1934.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.64}, {"id": "2157", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nOrdered the brown to go with the new Neater Feeder Cat Deluxe in taupe that we purchased.

When Northrup returns she is taken aback by how handsome he has become; unlike when she knew (& objected to) him previously when he was a gawky, ginger headed, arrogant young man. She was quite happy to welcome & encourage the attentions of another supposedly charming gentleman but when Northrup appears to pay attention to a friend of hers in one of their \"etiquette lessons, she gets jealous & snippy.\n\nThe story was somewhat abrupt & I found it quite absurd overall.\n\nSWEETER THAN ANY DREAM by Annette Lyon.\nAt 28, Lady Olivia has long resigned herself to spinsterhood & living with her dragon of a mother & aunt. She has long molded herself into a quiet, dutiful daughter who never gainsays them & whose behavior does not raise their censure. To escape the bleakness of her life, she escapes to a world she creates in her imagination (that include her Prince!)\n\nA sweet & lovely story tho its hard to imagine anyones mother & aunt being so dour & generally nasty. A little bit oa a Cinderella tale with her brother & his wife who collectively play the fairy godmother! Olivia is sweet & intelligent - she loves to read. The hero Edward is an old school chum of her brothers. The romance is sweet & tender.\n\nAN INVITATION TO DANCE by Michele Paige Holmes\nLady Eleanora Whitticomb, Ella has been living on her own on her fathers country manor for several years since her mother died & her father in his grief took to travelling. The only thing she has from her father is a promise of a birthday gift when she turns twenty, which she has been hoping is his agreeing for her to join him. When a stranger turns up with an invitation to London from her (deceased!) betrothed , she initially rejects the invitation but later reconsiders hoping that the trip will prove to her father that she is mature enough to accompany him In his travels.\n\nElla is a most likeable heroine. She is more comfortable on a horse, or walking in the country with a fishing rod over her shoulder. Shes unpretentious & wholesome & doesnt care much for the silly rules of the ton or angling to catch a rich & titled husband. The romance between her & Alex  the stranger who brings her the invitation to London is sweet & wholesome with Ella showing him that he can be all he wants to be in spite of his disability - he has lost the use of his right hand.\n\nI've quickly come to enjoy these Anthologies.

Her 2 older sisters try to discover who was responsible for destroying their father (coincidentally they have 3 suspects) & Sophie decides to go back to their previous home & live in a cottage on the ground estates with their former nanny.\n\nWhen Sophie's nanny has an accident & is taken to a nursing home, in desperation Sophie goes to the Main House with a vague idea of seeking employment. She is met by the butler who immediately takes her for the new cook that they have been expecting which Sophie happily falls in with (being an excellent cook & loving it). The comedy of mistaken identity goes even further with the Viscount who takes her for the courtesan/mistress that he had contracted for from London.\n\nI loved the book! Wonderful writing & storytelling. The author's style of writing is lovely. Fluid & totally carries you along with characters that you immediately feel connected with. Sophie is by no means perfect. She's rather vain. She's beautiful & knows it. She plans to marry a rich, titled gentleman. She still comes across as someone totally likable. Her relationship with Alexander is so amusing! She's quite innocent in a lot of ways & their conversations are full of double entendres which Sophie doesn't realize at all. She's talking about cooking while he takes everything she says in a sexual context (delicious, satisfying his appetite - you get the drift!).\n\nAlexander is totally swoonworthy. The brooding, sardonic hero who, when he falls for Sophie falls hard.\n\nThere's a lovely cast of secondary characters - Alexander's butler/valet Dickens is particularly lovable. It was most touching when all his servants took Sophie's part & were very protective of her.\n\nThis is the 3rd book in the series.

Throughout this sterling song cycle, Joni lays her soul bare in such  beautiful, loving tunes as \"My Old Man\", \"Carey\"  \"A Case Of You\" and my personal favorites: the gorgeous title  song, \"A Little Green\" and \"The Last Time I Saw  Richard\" , songs so rich in detail they seem to place the listener  right in midst of what's going on.

In order for the reader to feel engaged, there must be tension on every page.  Mission accomplished.  (Of course, the tension on every page is the knowledge that we know a murder takes place at the end.)  After a while, though, you might find yourself saying, \"Just leave the marriage, Janine.\"  I hate to say this, because it sounds cold, but without the murder at the end, this book would never have been published.  My sympathies to the family but I never saw Janine as quite the victim she made of herself.  Her husband Kurt says nasty things, and can seem hateful and overly-jealous.  In other words, the guy's terribly insecure and she paints him strongly with a series of snotty remarks that build to something just this side of psychotic.  We get enough of the good times to see that he's probably not as bad as she describes him, mainly because she seems smart, smart enough to know better.  Her Dad is a real creep job and she has been horrifyingly violated in a rape she never disclosed to her family.  As her memoir went on, however, I couldn't help wondering if she was leaving out some of her responsibility in the dissolution of their marriage.  After her husband freaks over an imaginary encounter, she announces that \"it's over.\"  However, she still continues to consider herself victimized, saying she will be broke, homeless, etc. when we know this is untrue.  She is the wife of a successful man, who has gone into marriage counseling with her several times, and she will be taken care of.  I found her voice to be spare yet muscular and evocative, and I liked it.  I'm not sure I trusted it, but I liked it.  As for liking the story itself, not so much, though it may be empowering to women who struggle with self-esteem issues in bad relationships.  I am however, sorry for Janine's loss and that of her family.  Her sister was special.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

They usually work and play hard and think of themselves as the luckiest people in the world because they are essentially their own bosses.  The fact that their lives are constantly at risk in the commission of making a living seems to be a minor consideration.  I, like many others, am in awe of people such as this and I found this book to be a fascinating glimpse into what happens when you hit 40 and start to think about settling down.  I think I'd be looking for a nice quiet country place with a yard, maybe a pond too.  Judith Matloff thought it might be nice to raise a family on a block infested with violent psychopathic crackmonsters.  Hey, to each their own!  It makes sense.  If adventure is in your blood, you don't move out to suburbia, even when you \"settle down.\"\n\nI loved reading this book and didn't want it to end.  I found Judith gutsy and compassionate -- two qualities I especially like to find in a person, and so I loved the way she told the story.  She is by turns frightened, witty, compassonate, and ultimately victorious.\n\nI found it hard to believe that some of the people she knew from her reporting days, those who lived in war-ravaged countries where mass murder and rape were common occurrences, were afraid to visit her in Harlem.  When she arrives on the block, and meets her nemesis, the notorious Salami, the local black population knows they've got a chance to get their neighborhood back.  \"They'll listen to you, because you're white,\" one woman says to her.  And it's true.  But it's not only the fact that the author is white that gets things going, it's the fact that she's willing to do the footwork, go to the meetings, chat up the civil servants, and follow through that creates the conditions she, and the rest of the block, are hoping for.\n\nI have never read a memoir of a person who toils in fields of misery for a living.  I finished this book in two days, and wanted more.  The author has a gift for bringing the characters on her block to life.  She sees good everywhere and is only slightly intimidated by even the scariest crackhead.\n\nI got a kick out of the author's husband, who is like many of my Dutch relatives -- a bit arrogant and condescending, in general, and towards the USA most specifically, and I especially enjoyed Mrs. La Dukes.  In fact, this book is packed with indelible characters that I hated to say goodbye to.  I was glad the author provided an epilogue so that we could find out what happened to them.\n\nFive stars, great read!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.74}, {"id": "2170", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nBook provided by the author.\n\nAnother exciting hot little read, again very well written with some feisty characters and an interesting plot.\nAgain I wish it was longer, I'm impatiently waiting for the next installment in this series\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The second reason and perhaps even more disturbing is like those family and friends of addicts who keep hoping that the addict will see the light and STOP, I kept hoping that Rachel would realize that what she got from her addiction wasn't worth what it cost her.  But of course, she kept drinking--and letting the reader down.  In this horrible \"hope\", the author did succeed in getting this reader to \"invest\" in the character of Rachel, hating her and this book for doing so.\n\n**Update.  I watched the movie \"Gone Girl\" and agree.  This book doesn't come close to Gone Girl.  While Girl on the train had no one the reader could cheer on, Amy of Gone Girl was deliciously evil, finding a clever way to get back at her cheating husband.  Again, I didn't read the book Gone Girl, but I really enjoyed the movie.

Right now I do not have the counter space and that disappoints me.  Thy are sitting on an ugly old plastic shelf for the time being.\n\nI've given some thought to how many cannister sets I have owned of various sizes, shapes, designs and materials.  Many with the promise of having a great seal.  I can not count how many times I have been let down.\n\nThis set delivers on being air tight.  The rubber ring is ridged and seems to give an edge to the seal they provide, I am hesitant to store things like coffee in cannisters due to sealing issues and instead store it in my freezer.  I am not having these doubts with this set.  We go through a lot of coffee so I was not too worried about being able to use it before it goes rancid, providing I could keep it fresh.\n\nI've even shown tipping the cannister upside down full of beans, I did give it a few good shakes, and trust me I was holding my breath that it would hold haha.  Glad to report to you that it did!  I can not comment as to if it would hold if they were dropped,  my guess is erring to the maybe not, could depend on how they land since they do not screw into anything. I can only say that they are solidly plugged and give a pop when they come off, you do have to give them a bit of a nudge  to break the seal.  So who knows, not something I am hoping to find out any time soon though however.  But then again I am not too sure any cannister would.\n\nI have my beans stored in the smallest cannister, that is a 1 pound bag of beans minus 2 small pots.  A typical bag of coffee is around 12 ounces.\n\nThese cannisters are generous in sizing without being overly large or too small to be of any use.\n\nThe finish on them is really nice too, high gloss black, it appears to be powder coated, they are also available in a fire engine red.  They are made from stainless steel.  I am most fond of stainless steel anything and the co-ordinating black and stainless finish is a perfect match for my other appliances.  They are also a great weight, while they are not rediculously heavy they are no where near flimsy.\n\nThe finish also makes them easy to keep clean and in my opinion a lot more sanitary than anything besides glass.  I love the finish, it is sleek and modern.\n\nThe windows are plastic, it is the only plastic thing you will find on the cannisters besides the seals.

Iris is given two choices by her mother: marry a stranger in England (who sounded quite revolting) or marry a stranger in Kenya. She choose Kenya and she was very lucky that she had such a lovely chaperone in the form of Miss Logan.

Set in ancient Mesopotamia, the story follows 16-year-old Jayden as her family attempts to cross the desert to their winter oasis after a family tragedy. Still reeling from her loss and  anxious about the dangers of the crossing (particularly as they've been separated from the rest of their tribe), Jayden meets an unusual stranger who needs her family's help. Of course, Jayden is intrigued by the newcomer.\n\nThere's just one problem. Jayden is already betrothed. To Horeb, set to become their tribe's leader after his father's death. But Jayden doesn't like or trust Horeb, who has become increasingly shifty and cruel. Adding to this complication is her sister's growing fascination with the goddess temple to Ashtoreth, which goes against everything Jayden's mother and grandmother have taught them. As the novel progresses, Jayden has to figure out what truths are most important to her--and what she will have to sacrifice to stay true to herself.\n\nFor me, the setting (cultural and physical) of the novel was one of my favorite parts. I loved The Red Tent back when it came out, and I enjoyed revisiting a world where the women of a tribe had such a lovely, close-knit bond. Looking at some of the history behind belly dancing was also fascinating to me. Little does a nice job evoking the setting--at once harsh and beautiful. I liked, too, that Jayden's issues with her sister were realistic and complicated, how Jayden both loves her sister but struggles to understand her choices. There were a few places in the last half of the novel where the plot swirled quite quickly, and sometimes I struggled to keep pace with the twists, but I'm not sure that is a bad thing! I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how Jayden's story resolves in the rest of the series.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Her opportunity comes in the unlikely form of a boy named Jin, who's wanted by the Sultan's soldiers. But as Amina gets farther from the world she was born to and learns more about the politics destroying her native land and the rebellion growing to change that, the more she begins to question who she really is--and what she wants.\n\nI loved this book--I loved Amina's strength, and Jin's humor (even when it got him in trouble.

I purposely left my house full of stuff (we are redoing the kitchen and stuff is everywhere) and it did quite well avoiding obstacles.\n\nIt will go back home and recharge itself (takes about 2-3 hours) and then go back and complete the job.\n\nIt does a better job of finding home than any other robot vacuum I have had, and seems to reserve power to do so.\n\nIt picks up even fine dust.  I have been forcing it to clean around the house while we are in the midst of a kitchen remodel, and I was surprised by how fine the dust it picked up.\n\nIt can navigate over fairly tall thresholds (even an inch high one) which my other vacuums could not.\n\nIt is easy to clean the brush and to remove the dirt collecting cup (which holds about 3 times as much as my other vacuum)\n\nIt will work without connecting it to WIFI or the app (just wanders around cleaning, sometimes with some purpose, sometimes it seems a bit random)\n\nIt can handle the throw rugs in my bathrooms.\n\nIt works fine on dark tile.\n\nIt extracts itself pretty well from tight spots.\n\nCons:\nIt is taller than my ILIFE and will not fit under some furniture.\n\nOn Turbo mode it is reasonably loud,  too loud to have a conversation in the room without raising your voice.\n\nIt struggles with the three inch fringe on one of my rugs.  Does not usually tangle too badly, but it is often beeping for help when dealing with the fringe.\n\nThe magnetic strip to block the vacuum has no instructions and is pretty useless.  You are supposed to stick it down (like perhaps around a litter box?) .\n\nTall ceilings seem to confuse it, it does a much better job in my kitchen and bedrooms than in the living room with vaulted ceilings.

It appears to be designed for all Samsung appliances.  It is easy to set up but I found using it somewhat counter intuitive.\n\nOverall:\n\nFrankly I am not sure it is worth the price point, you need to consider how often you need to vacuum.  If you have pets and need to vacuum daily, this may be worth it.  If you only vacuum once a week you might want to consider the cost.  It does vacuum much better than my  ILIVE device which is about one seventh the price, but you might be better off with a cheaper robot vacuum and a good upright (to really get the carpets clean) if you do not need to vacuum often.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I turned around one time to find him pushing a rolling chair (on laminate) and he will push short flat objects that are too short for him to see (like a pair of scissors) around.  Where there is more friction (on a carpet) he will push over some objects. He pushed over a lightweight lamp (weighs 18 oz) of my daughter's, which has fiber optic strands at the top and then he chewed on the strands and broke some of them.\n\nDoes not do that well with vacuuming the carpet, the same stuff that he will pick up often gets left behind (small wrappers) on the carpet.  I imagine this is due to the larger amount of friction between the object and the carpet.\n\nThe absolute biggest con is that he cannot be programmed to start cleaning at a certain time each day.

You CANNOT set it up to say, clean at 9am every day.

Collected from 2014, 2015 and 2016 are Astro City # 17, #22, #25, #27-28 and #31.\n\nThe artists included are a very International group with Spanish Artist Jesus Merino doing half of the stories.  While Australian Artist Gary Chaloner does one and the then two Artists working out of Canada each do one story apiece Tom Grummett and Joe Infurnari.\n\nThe thing I feel makes Astro City such a success is the characters are grounded in the real world and that  the stories usually involve an Epic Saga taking place over many years. Instead of the usual superhero comic which usually covers just a few hours in the hero's life.\n\nIn the first story Sorrowsday we find out that the magically appearing \"red cake\" which arrives every year is linked to a very strange mystery.  We also get the death of an Honor Guard member.\n\nThe next story Hero's Reward is a Starfighter story and my favorite of the collection. It has echoes of John Carter on Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nLucky Girl is also excellent focusing on the life of Hummingbird. The 4th story Game Over was my least favorite. I didn't really like the \"cutesy\" American Chibi or Infurnari's art for that matter.\n\nThings bounce back to excellent for the fifth story by Gary Chaloner. It features Wolf Spider and a group of Australian Superheroes.  We close out the collection with Nightmare Life about the Living Nightmare.\n\nWe also get all the beautiful Alex Ross painted covers plus a 12 page sketchbook featuring character designs by Alex and the other pencilers.\n\nMy Highest Recommendation.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.24}, {"id": "21102", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nFinally a book with great characters, plot, and emotions.

It's well written, funny and hot romance where a MMA fighter and a cop meets a doctor, a woman from his past.\n\nPlot:\n\nChrissy, a doctor who has been working all over the globe at different catastrophe areas, is returning to her hometown to bale out her brother from the prison. She has estranged relationship with Slade. They used to be very close, until the day, their father died. Still, whenever Slade, the MMA fighter, is in trouble, he calls Chrissy, his only living family.\n\nOn her way to the jailhouse, she is stopped by a police officer. To her surprise, the cop is the best friend of Chrissy's brother. When Jack recognizes Chrissy, sparks fly! There is a history between Chrissy and Jack, and even there is a lot of attraction in the play, there are obstacles. Jack has always seen Chrissy as a little sister (at least until they meet again) and Chrissy doesn't like the idea Jack being a MMA fighter like her brother is and Jack is also well-known player. These things doesn't fit into Chrissy's plans.\n\nCharacters:\n\nI liked Chrissy because she was independent and strong woman. I did not understand few things about her though and there were times where I couldn't relate to her. Her constant complaining and worry about MMA fights remained a mystery for me. I did understand that she was worried about her brother, but her overly strong stand against legal fights was a mystery for me. How can a woman who is working with heavily injured people daily, be so overwhelmingly nervous? I didn't understand that. She seemed little whiny when it came to what her brother did for living.\n\nI loved Jack for several reasons. The biggest reason is probably how he cared for both Chrissy and Slade. I loved the close relationship between Jack and Slade and how Jack was the voice of reason for Slade.\n\nI also enjoyed the relationship dynamics between Jack and Chrissy.\n\nI would like to add, that the supporting characters were a lot of fun to read about! They gave a lot of added value to the book. I loved Slade and I am glad, that the second book in the series is about him! But all the other guys from the WtF Academy were enjoyable and well-written.

The main story is about a video tape that keeps getting people killed and the people who come in contact with it. So, you watch people from multiple walks of life all tangentially related to the New York 80s sex / porno / prostitution scene. Vice cops, VHS distributors, prostitutes, junkies, businessmen, and their various associates all mingle about doing generally degrading things to each other. Parts of it seem pretty authentic. The seediness and class structure is communicated well. Not to mention the fantasy aspects of it all. The women are all in costumes and the men often look confident and aggressive but are the exact opposite. It's the sort of world where every is constantly lying\n\nThe bad is that the writers even before you get to the interviews in the back are obviously overly obsessed with the election of Donald Trump. Because of that, the story goes off track multiple times and it seems that the villain was probably going to be a different character moral crusader type before it became Trump. It leads to there being a disjointed quality to the work that's frustrating. You start seeing little plot holes here and there. Big jumps in logic occur or happen off page and you're just supposed to accept it. They maybe made these changes last minute and then had to work around it.  It also leads to them trying to go through a list of the progressive stack and include each the various causes-for-bored-rich-white-liberal-children groups in here.

Killing 1000 priests makes up for millions dead in the Holocaust. Oh and towards the last 3rd of the film, you learn about the healing powers of the Catholic church and the grace of Jesus Christ, which I agree completely with this last bit about Jesus.\n\nDespite all the above, the movie is bizarrely watchable and will stick with you as an utter mess.

It was manufactured in China and is sold by Rome Industries, Inc. (www dot romeindustries dot com).  Rome Industries is a family-owned business with locations in Peoria, Illinois and Madison, Wisconsin.  Their website indicates that they specialize in garden ornaments such a sundials and pedestals and outdoor cookware for camping and fire pits.  The stand I purchased was fulfilled by Amazon and shipped to me in a single item box by UPS.  It is made of wrought iron and, as can be seen in the advertising picture, it is painted black with a powder coated finish.  The stand is very sturdy.  The legs are 5/16 inch diameter metal rods.  Rome promotes is as a pedestal base designed for mounting Rome sundials but, as you can see, it is simply a generic metal stand that can be used to mount any number of things.  The top is a flat three inch diameter metal disk with a 1/2 inch diameter hole in the center.  One thing you should note, at a 24 inch height, it is definitely short.  For outdoor applications, the metal rod legs are well suited for pushing the stand down into the ground to ensure stability.  However, that will further reduce the height.  If you plan to use it outdoors, you should probably assume the stand will only be about 20 to 22 inches high.  So, if you are looking for a sturdy short stand then this will be a good buy.  It was a five star buy for me.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Pit Posse advertises is as a lift for motorcycles and ATV's, but I'll probably use it for transmissions.  The jack specs have been painted over but it appears to be the size of a 2 to 3 ton jack.  The metal lift structure built around the jack is a \"scissor\" mechanism that extends from a bottom of 13 1/2 inches to a maximum height of 34 1/2 inches.  The rectangular rubber covered platform is 13 3/4 inches by 16 inches with a rectangular hole in the middle.  The maximum load that can be lifted is 300 pounds.  The stand is painted black and comes with two retaining hooks to help stabilize what you are lifting.  It arrived in a 70 pound box, fully assembled with the exception of the foot pedal jack control.  Unfortunately, the pedal rod was about a 1/4 inch too long and bottomed out in the jack handle sleeve before the retaining bolts holes aligned.  Accordingly, I cut off about a 1/2 inch off the end of the rod and everything lined up.  Other than that, the stand seems to work well and is reasonably constructed.\n\nThe one main concern I have is safety.  Remember the higher a load is lifted, the more top heavy it becomes.  It wouldn't take much to tip it over, especially when rolling it around.  If a wheel hits one little bump the lift can easily tilt and fall over.  The designer really needs to add some kind of support legs that can be extended to increase the width of the lift support base.  The bottom support stand has holes for a retaining rod that locks the lift height at four different levels to prevent height creep from jack leakage and sudden drops from jack failure.  You should always use this safety feature while working.  Overall, the stand is reasonably priced and functioned as advertised, but be careful using it with heavy loads...five stars.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.24}, {"id": "21123", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nActually, I had no expectations for this movie but it was nice.

But if you take the chance to read this book, you'll see it's so much more than that. Life isn't always all black and white. All these characters have major shades of gray.\nI'm glad I gave this book a chance. I was worried that with the character Ysabelle, and her profession, it was going to be based on sex. I'm a prude by no means, I just like story to go hand in hand with the sex.\nIf the emotions and spark aren't there, the scene, no matter how well wrote, would be no better than a porno. I'm so glad that wasn't the case here.\nI loved Ysabelle, the childhood she struggled to survive alone, the strong willed woman she struggled to be. The vulnerable parts that she left show, every now and again. She didn't let her $*** past keep her skittish and use it to be annoying and whiney. She let it build her to be the lady she always wanted to be.\nI liked Sebastian, he didn't set out to do what he did, but he did have the best of intentions (in a situation that was going to happen regardless). He's not the alpha, box boy type we grow accustomed to in so many fictional books. He's human. That's the only way I can describe him. He has so many faults, but tries to be the man everyone around him expect him to be. He wears a mask with the company he holds.\nI liked how the reader grew up with characters and got a sense of them and their character, before the actual \"life\" situation came about. It brought better understanding to lead to his actions. I am no way saying, \"it's okay to cheat.\" But there's more to it than anyone could see coming.\nM.

Her husband is kind but not passionate. Her kids are good but ordinary. Shes given up her law career, has not had sex in two years, and she and her husband don't even sleep together, period. Her mundane life leads her to think often of the passionate romance and sexual awakening she had as a teenager with an older man, Tol, a writer and recluse. Much of the story is told as a flashback to this time in her life, all the way through the end of the relationship, as well as her present life, and the emotional turmoil she endured as a child and teen.\n\nThis story was interesting. It was told in 2nd person narrative, though, which seems very awkward and clunky to me, and the few times Ive read books from this POV, Ive disliked it. It made me feel a disconnect from the story and characters somewhat, so I did have a problem with that. I also thought the story started out very slowly and I was not very interested or invested for the first fourth of the book or so. However, after I got used to the style a bit, I did begin to enjoy it a bit better. The story eventually goes back in time to her youth, so I enjoyed seeing what led up to the woman she has become. I often like stories that reveal a persons whole life and history. Its nice to see why people are the way they are so that was good.\n\nWhile I was interested enough in the story to keep reading, I never felt compelled to race home to pick it back up. I was interested in it while reading, but never thought about it while I wasnt.\n\nThe storyline itself is quite fascinating and something Id typically enjoy reading, but it wasn't written in a way that grabbed me completely. The writing is lyrical and smart, but I felt that it caused the story to drag a bit. I would have enjoyed it better if the writing was more straightforward and casual, as well as if it was in 1st or 3rd person narrative instead of 2nd (which narrates as you).\n\nI think if you're a fan of literary fiction, and the topic of sexuality, you will really enjoy this story. It wasn't completely for me, but it wasn't a waste of time either. Im certain theres a proper market for this title out there, but its a strange mixture of literary / almost-erotica and youd have to be a fan of both.

Chemistry was forced and lacked sufficient explanation as to why these people were even attracted to each other. How Lee managed not to kill herself is surprising as her depression is so deep and complex that the reader almost wishes she would just so she would feel something. The attraction of Tarry as a person is severely lacking. Could not like her. She came across as a bully and incredibly arrogant. I never understood why Lee was dying at the end. She was impossible to understand. I feel certain this is a series and one or both of the main characters might be an alien or part of one. If this was a set up book then I will back off the review somewhat. And if that is the case the writer should have made it clear in the beginning.

It is more than ok but I am not sure how far into really liking it it goes.  Mainly due to the overload of too many types of supernatural bad guys and their descriptions which kinda bogged things down.  Each chapter seems to bring out a new and unknown monster, written as an entry from a made up book that the two hapless new employees of the Dept of Magic find that they need to read to learn the ins and out of their new job which they take with out really knowing that it is not a job they can leave so easily.\n\nI really enjoyed the way the book went from one POV to another between the two characters.  As a matter of fact, Jasmine Farah, a slightly too perfect woman in all that she is capable of as well as being a former beauty queen and her partner Rocco \"Rocky\" di Angelo who is so poor he lives in a roach motel and barely eats are the main reason I trudged through this book.  The story is good,full of potential.  A super secret government department which dabbles in the paranormal in ways that Spooky Mulder in the X files could only have dreamed of.  The characters are good, if slightly flawed in their personalities.  It is the extra descriptions, the copious amount of bad guys who chase them, the fact that each small act seems to take many pages to describe which weighs the book down.  However, some of the bad guys, famous characters from history, are quite funny and you can't help but see the comedy in the tragedy being told.  There are places where the story gets a big muddy, but if you can get through that you may be surprised at the many directions the story takes before it finally reaches the end.\n\nI was given a free copy in exchange for an honest review.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It was the Romans that attacked and destroyed his home, his lands. It was Romans that killed his mother, his sister, and his father. Ilias, and his brothers in arms, swore that one day they'd exact their revenge and take back what is rightfully theirs. That day has finally come.\n\nHowever, Ilias didn't consider the effect Nerva might have on him. Nerva, the daughter of his sworn enemy and the central piece in his plot for revenge, doesn't elicit the hate Ilias thought she would. Rather, she elicits the need to protect and that threatens all the carefully laid plans.\n\nBorn in Vengeance is an extremely engaging novella, despite its length. Y'all know I usually take issue with novellas as I always feel deprived of character development. However, Born in Vengeance gave me just enough of a taste to want more. I enjoyed the historical aspect quite a lot. Now whether or not it's historically accurate outside of Dacians and Romans having really existed, I'm not sure. But it feels historically accurate.\n\nI also liked the love versus logic element as well. I think the internal battle Ilias waged was realistic, especially for a warrior. He fought to do right by his family, his people but also by Nerva. It is a strong leader who can stand up for what he believes in and sway his people to follow him.\n\nIlias and Nerva, as well as Zyraxes, Ursus, Bastisza, Galtys, are well developed, I felt the closeness these characters had cultivated and understood the turmoil caused by all the events in the story. Ms. Skiba allows us to see enough of their personalities to become invested in what happens to them. I really like that Nerva is a strong heroine. She doesn't back down in the face of danger. That, along with the realistic portrayal of battle during this time, kept me turning the pages. I'm anxious to read the complete Dacian Legends series.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I liked the element of questioning the social structures, and the forbidden or shameful element those structures gave to their relationship. I do wish there had been a bit more character development. I would have liked to see more in the building of their relationship. And I would have liked a bit more historical description of the place and times, to put me more into the story. Of course, the story mainly takes place within a single room, so hopefully that feeling will come in future installments.

I read a lot of autobiographies and this was one of the easiest to read, considering it is such a long book.  I read every page.  Norman really has had a remarkable life.  I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because I was hoping for more behind the scenes stories about \"All in the Family\" and some of his other shows, but it is very limited in regards to those shows.  He barely mentions \"Sanford and Son\" and I would have loved to hear some Redd Foxx stories!!  A lot of time is spent on \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" but I was never a big fan of that show.  There are a lot of good stories about working with Martin and Lewis, Frank Sinatra and Ronald Reagan.  I found the lesson that he learned from Hans Conreid about working to work instead of to make money very inspirational.  Norman spends a lot of time talking about his childhood in which he recreates so many specific details that it is truly amazing considering his age.  I barely remember a thing about my childhood but he remembers every single slight that ever happened to him at the hand of his parents.  He really spends a lot of time taking shots at his parents in this book and I ended up feeling bad for them.  What is the gain in doing that now that they are gone?  Is it really necessary to bring up all of the times they didn't give him as much attention as other kids got from their parents?  I think things turned out well for him and he is a creative genius, so let's not air the family laundry!  The last few chapters seemed to be put together in a hurry and were not as enjoyable as the rest of the book because they focused on political activism.  Overall, this is a very good book and it's fun to read and even though I may disagree with some of the things Norman says in this book, I have a higher respect for him and like him even more after reading this book.  Also, it was great to read about his WWII service!

THE MOONSTONE AND MISS JONES takes readers on a crazy and thrilling journey into the darker side of Victorian London that you won't want to miss.\n\nFor Miss America Jones, traveling with the deliciously charming Phaeton Black on the sea week after week has been a dream come true. Yet when her lover is shanghaied in Shanghai, she can feel nothing less than anger at being abandoned. Now she's traveled all the way to London to track down the elusive detective determined to give him her worst. Except when she arrives, she discovers Phaeton is in danger again.\n\nSince he is the owner of a mysterious moonstone, previously bestowed on him by an Egyptian goddess, only he has the ability to unleash its power. With plenty of enemies trying to hunt down the moonstone, Phaeton and America must once again face the mysterious and unknown to find a solution that will keep them safe. As if that was not enough, America is hiding a secret that will certainly change Phaeton's life forever.\n\nIt is always a joy to travel through the fantastically fun and quirky world created in the Paranormal Investigator series. Jillian Stone has a rich prose that creates another place of fabulous wonder. Every character and plot point build such an entertaining story that comes alive on the page. Ms Stone doesn't overuse flowery and pointed descriptions, rather she tells her story with direct dialogue. The quick retorts help amp up the pace of the novel and keeps things moving quickly. Not only that, but the dialogue is intelligent and extremely witty. It gives the story a great amount of humor and a charming lightness that certainly make the ride that much more enjoyable.\n\nFor new readers that haven't experienced the first journey into this series, my advice would be to read this series in order. I would say it's not necessary, but recommended. The events of the last novel have a close connection with this novel, but the details are gently rehashed in THE MOONSTONE AND MISS JONES and the investigation itself is a separate case. So there is really no chance you would be completely lost but having read the first one will give you greater insight into the characters and their personalities.\n\nMy overall appreciation of this series does have one drawback. I would be completely over the moon in love with this series IF I knew what to make of Phaeton Black and his attachment to America Jones. Theirs is such a weird relationship, you just never know what to think. Phaeton has all these beautiful words and phrases concerning his feelings for her, but he rarely voices them to America. The horrible thing about Phaeton is his actions usually speak louder than his words. Unfortunately, his actions never reveal complete devotion to America and that always brings my enjoyment of these novels down. America remains dutifully by his side because she loves him fiercely, but she never knows exactly how Phaeton feels.\n\nGranted, as a couple, Phaeton and America aren't the next Romeo and Juliet. If I were to review this book based on the protagonists as separate characters, they would be fantastic. Phaeton is a great leading man with a wolfish charm and seductive wit while Miss Jones is the inquisitive companion with a fiery spirit and a heart of gold. Together, they do have their fair share of utterly sweet moments, so I can't dismiss their relationship altogether. Phaeton and America are still exploring their scorching chemistry. Fans that delighted in the carnal mischief of the first novel will not be let down by THE MOONSTONE AND MISS JONES. You will still be able to appreciate the passion they share. One so strong, it seems as if at any moment it will consume them both.\n\nOverall, THE MOONSTONE AND MISS JONES is a great story. I can't say enough about the fabulous and exotic world Jillian Stone has created and how it sucks you into its heavenly spell. If you enjoy a thrilling steampunk or a fast paced paranormal, you will enjoy this crazy adventure.\n\nLisa Jo @ The Romance Reviews\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

This sexy couple will take you on a wild ride through the streets of Victorian London where mystery and adventure collide!\n\nPhaeton Black is a man of many talents. As a paranormal investigator with uncanny abilities, he solves the most unusual crimes for Scotland Yard. Yet he's also a generous lover that enjoys seducing his fair share of wicked women. When a young attractive female holds a knife to his throat and demands he make love to her, more than Phaeton's curiosity is aroused. He quickly realizes Miss America Jones is a sexy distraction that is more addictive than absinthe. He is searching for a fanged villain that drinks its victims' blood and she's hot on the trail of the man that stole her father's ships. Together, they form an unlikely pair of investigators searching for clues one minute and exploring their explosive passion the next. As the adventure unfolds, attractions grow strong and danger lurks at every corner. Yet the greatest danger Phaeton and America face may be the risk of losing their hearts.\n\nTHE SEDUCTION OF PHAETON BLACK is a fun and absolutely thrilling read. Think Sherlock Holmes only with some paranormal craziness, a female companion and a bit more erotic! This novel is all that and more. Ms Stone pulls together a truly exciting read with great characters, powerful plot lines and fabulous drama. Then of course there are the steampunk elements that really make this a unique and worthwhile read.\n\nPhaeton is the scandalously bad leading man...but in a desirable way. You can tell right away he is the kind of man that will leave a woman satisfied yet begging for more. He does not mince words and says exactly what is on his mind, which can lead to some hilarious moments concerning his lustful thoughts. Miss Jones throws him for a loop though. So there is some pleasure to be derived from seeing this poor character squirm under the prospect of change because of one woman. He keeps his life neat and clean of attachments and as America launches herself into his life, you see the small transformations of this deliciously attractive man. While these changes may drive him crazy, he becomes even more irresistible to America.\n\nAmerica is definitely a different kind of leading lady. She is a fantastically unique and independent spirit. As the daughter of a New Orleans witch and an English sea captain, you can expect nothing less. She fought with everything she had when a fight presented itself and she loved with all her heart when the right man came into her life. Love is a foreign word to Mr. Black and America has the patience of a saint waiting for him to wake up and see the reality of what they share. America is an amazing character because she gave as much love as she could give, but never demanded anything in return. You not only want to root for her, but gain a large amount of respect her character.\n\nStill, here's the disclaimer...if you're looking for the sweeping romance with the steampunk background, this may not be everything you want. While Phaeton and America may start building on a relationship in this novel, things aren't perfect between them. Which makes sense since this is the first in a series that will continue to follow these two extravagant characters. So the romance does move a bit slower than fans may like.\n\nTHE SEDUCTION OF PHAETON BLACK is incredibly erotic...so much so it's a wonder you can hold the book and not scorch your fingers. Both characters share a passionate nature and attraction that seems to become more overwhelming each time they are together. Ms Stone does a great job of molding their relationship, but I would have appreciated a few more `sweet moments' contributing to a fulfilling romance.\n\nFans of the steampunk genre will not be disappointed in THE SEDUCTION OF PHAETON BLACK.

When still living at home, her mom moved about the house a great deal during the day and during the night, looking for things to do. Her mom was able to walk pretty well and liked going out  for walks, shopping, going to restaurants, and comparatively brief times of attention to close/snuggly/craft and reminiscence activities. Her mother was still continent, so outings were not a problem if visits to bathroom every 1-2 hours. At the point this book was written, her Mom was mid-stage in dementia, and could still express her happy/unhappy feelings, and was good-to-go if feeling the security of the author every moment with her.\n\nIt's helpful to know the above things if you are looking to this book to help guide you to structure your own visits to your loved one living in long term care facility. Perhaps your loved one has similar characteristics.  It may be helpful even if your loved one is a man, because the overall thought process to structure visits is the same, but the craft activities might be very different depending on what the loved one's favorite activity with his hands was. (gardening? tinkering/pseudo repairing a small appliance? tinkering pseudo repairing a chair? if he wants to put something together, or take something apart, find that something he's willing to work on? )\n\nThe first part of book is very personal, thoughtful, truthful telling of the author's emotional and coping journey of caring for her Mom. The author is deeply devoted to her Mom and follows a faith-based line of thinking to ground/guide herself and ultimately learn to accept changes. It was a hard emotional journey for the author. Yet she tells her story in a positive way, with great short stories about living with her Mom, which are often funny.  It's easy to read, and author bares her own emotional difficulties, which I felt much empathy for.\n\nThe second part of book is amazingly right-on, detail after detail, of how to have an upbeat emotional tone when you visit, and how to bring/do things that create a joyful stress free time for the loved one. (I've been studying this and working with people with dementia as a companion and activities provider for the last two years)  Regular positive visits go a very long way to help the loved one feel secure and content, even if living in long term care. Coupled with properly dementia-trained care aides, it's a magical combination for helping long term care feel more like a home than an institution. For visit's just a matter of finding the activities that are a good match for your loved one. Both people (visitor and visitee) really need the \"minutes or hours of joy\" of a positive visit, to help balance the feelings of grief and sadness.\n\nThe author also shares her initial great discomfort, and ultimate positive solutions, regarding the inevitable interactions with other residents when visiting a loved one living in a long term care facility. This is another barrier many people have when contemplating visiting their loved one in a facility. The author is so truthful about her feelings, her journey to overcome this, and how to make that aspect also a positive experience for herself. She gives very helpful advice.\n\nThere's also useful and realistic advice about how to monitor the quality of care your loved one is getting in the facility (but it's not a how-to book about picking facility), how to speak to staff about it, how to be your loved one's advocate.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Like Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, Reese carries the film.  She is so confident and charismatic in her performance as a seemingly dumb blonde (a sharpie in blonde's clothing) that the film is worth a rent.\nOther positives:  great soundtrack of girl songs, terrific DVD features about the making of the movie and the outtakes - there are a huge amount of extras here.\nWhat makes it not \"buyable\"?  The rest of the cast is forgettable, unlike Clueless, which featured great support for Silverstone, Reese is forced to carry the movie.  Both love interests are unworthy of her and there is little or no chemistry, there are no breakout character actresses in the ranks of other students in the sorority or in law school.  The familiar actor playing the high powered law school professor, Callahan, changes so quickly into a lounge lizard, it will make your head spin.  The actress who plays Paulette, the manicurist that Elle befriends, is not believable in the role.  Exceptions?  A great chihuahua, and the fabulous Holland Taylor as the woman law school professor....\nIn an effort to transform a California girl into a Harvard Law student, the filmmakers go too far into the \"Barbie syndrome\"...fashions and accessories are too girlie and just too adolescent to be believable.  A great illustration - while Elle is getting ready for her \"engagement dinner\" (which turns out to be where she gets dumped) she tries on a knockout dress in turquoise.  Unbelievably, she appears ready for dinner in a cheap red and black number, instead.\nA nice flick for chicks where the misunderstood heroine gets more than just the man she adores, she shows the world she is a person of quality, without giving up the girlish touches that make her unique.  Witherspoon proves she can carry a comedy, but her film presence is so strong, we all hope it will translate into meatier roles in the future, and not just give her the opportunity to host Saturday Night Live.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I guess if they had tried to follow up the success of the equally ditzy/funny \"Clueless\" movie, they would have not succeeded, and they didn't here, either.\n\nIt feels as though this movie was named first...\"Red, White and Blonde\", and then someone found a screenwriter who was willing to sacrifice their craft to come up with something, anything that would match the title.  They chose to move Elle to Washington, D.C., for a little \"Mr. Smith, Mr. Deeds\" action -- this time the crusade being for animal rights.  Director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld was successful with \"Kissing Jessica Stein\", but proves he can't direct what might have been a \"for laughs\" comedy.  All kinds of things get in the way, such as the\nfar-fetched warming of a curmudgeonly woman senator, who warms to Elle just because they were both Delta Nu's.  There is a sidebar to the animal portion of the story that deals with the sexual persuasion of Elle's chihuahua that was definitely not needed.\n\nThere are some satirical bits, some great costumes, the incomparable Bob Newhart, and a game performance by Reese Witherspoon, who should be telling her agent...\"absolutely not!\" to a third run at Elle Woods.

When loved ones seem to forget simple things, we may have the tendency to write them of as random quirks.  But when reflecting on memories, it's then that we clearly see what should have been red flags that somehow slipped past our attention.\n\nIn her debut book, Elaine Pereira captures the memories and struggles she now cherishes in her light-hearted account of her mother's battle with dementia. As I read the book, I reflected on my wife's grandmother who was also stricken with this disease, and although her life and Elaine's mother's were different, some of the details were unfortunately the same.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE BOOK:  After I finished reading the book, I was able to speak with Elaine to ask her a few questions.  I was honestly inquisitive about why she wrote the book because it didn't seem to have a singular message.  Instead, it came across as a memoir.  Elaine explained that it was just that: a memoir.  She did not want her mother, who was academically and professionally a successful woman, to be remembered as the person she was in her later years.  Instead, she wanted readers to remember Betty for who she truly was.  She wants people to remember Betty, not the disease that stole her personality.\n\nI would suppose Elaine would like her readers in similar situations to take this same notion away from the book.  When you struggle to care for your loved one suffering from this disease, recognize his/her characteristics and traits are not who those loved ones truly are.  Instead, behavior and memory flaws are the results of a horrible disease that steals the memories of good people. It is easy to get frustrated with the afflicted, but we must remember that it is not the individual person's fault, but the disease's.\n\nFORMAT:  Writing a historical account is challenging, in that the writer must tell linear history in a way that is interesting.  That said, I truly enjoyed the way Elaine wrote this memoir.  She wrote it in a back-and-forth fashion, not sticking to a particular timeline.\n\nFor instance, Elaine would reflect in flashback-fashion on a memory she had of, say, her mother teaching her how to bake, or a time when she got in trouble as a youngster.  Because she included funny stories of their younger lives, it was easy to like Betty and Elaine.  After telling a particular story, Elaine would then jump ahead to recent past years to tie the previous story to the point she attempted to make in the chapter.  While some readers may not like this back-and-forth style, I found it enjoyable because I didn't feel bogged down with matters of chronology.  Instead, I could simply enjoy the story for the purpose of the story.\n\nTRAGEDY:  I could never imagine the pain and grief entailed in burying my own children -- no matter how old we may be.  Elaine included the heart-breaking stories of Betty stoically laying two of her children to rest, along with her husband in later years.  Through it all, Betty was a champion, and I never sensed Betty ever complained \"woe is me\".  Just when you think your life is difficult, read a book about the struggles others have faced.\n\nEDITING:  I've read a number of self-published books over the years, and as far as editing is concerned, they are usually pretty weak in the editing department.  However, this book was absolutely flawless.  I complimented Elaine on this fact that she had no spelling, word-use, or grammatical errors (that I could see), and that I found it refreshing to read.  She said the self-publishing industry has given itself a bad reputation because given the right amount of money anyone can publish anything -- good or bad.  Instead, she hopes people will recognize there are quality authors who are self publishing for one reason or another, and that we simply need to sift through the other stuff.\n\nCONCLUSION:  So, that's the purpose of this review.  If you find yourself in the situation of caring for a loved who is suffering from dementia, you are not alone.  Maybe this book will be a heads-up to you if you're in the early stages with the disease; or maybe it will be a comforter knowing others struggle with you.  I hope this book will capture the attention from professionals in the medical field, and I think it will capture the interests of families in a similar situation as Elaine.\n\nRATING: While \"I Will Never Forget\" is not a page-turner, I found it enjoyable to read.  I give this one 4 stars.  I typically give 5 to those \"I-can't-put-this-one-down\" kind of book.  So, 4 is my opinion that this is a pretty high quality book.\n\nPROCEEDS: A portion of all the proceeds from sales of this book go to support Alzheimer's research.  If you buy on June 21st, \"the longest day\", however, Elaine will donate double to this much-needed research.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I received this book free of charge from the author.

We are fat, we suffer from depression, cancers are killing young and old alike, and we eat on the run from fast-food vendors.  The two leading causes of death for men, as listed by the Center for Disease Control (2008) were heart disease and cancer.  Those two led unintentional injuries, chronic respiratory diseases, and stroke by an overwhelming margin.  The top killers for women (2008) are identical, leading stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, and Alzheimer's by an overwhelming margin.\n\nBut Dr. James Marcum makes the case in his new book, \"Medicines that Kill\", that those CDC-named top killers actually be a distant second to an even more lethal one: Medicine.  It sounds strange that a medical doctor would point accusing fingers at an element of the medical field, but it only lends him credibility.\n\nREAL-LIFE EXAMPLES: Dr. Marcum gave numerous real-life examples throughout the book of the pitfalls of medications. Consider Brenda's story.  She's 43 years old, stands 5'4\", and carries 295 pounds.  She revealed to him how overwhelmed she had become.  She lost her marriage because her husband became an alcoholic.  She began eating and gaining weight, so her blood pressure increased.  As a result of a prescription to lower blood pressure, her legs swelled.  So she was prescribed a diuretic, which negatively reacted with the previous blood pressure medication.  On and on the story goes until Brenda is prescribed a whopping 16 medications, all combating problems onset by prior medications.\n\nDr. Marcum helped Brenda evaluate her life and its trajectory, took her through a series of medication step-downs, and she has conquered her initial weight gain, weighing half of her starting weight.  Marcum writes, \"Instead of funding weight-loss pills, how about promoting weight-loss programs?  Instead of sleeping pills, how about finding out why patients don't sleep well and getting at the cause rather than treating a symptom?  Instead of medicating pain, let's find out what is causing the pain?\" (p. 75)\n\nCONSIDERATIONS: Throughout the book, Dr. Marcum repeatedly asks his readers to consider first the root causes of the pain, and then to ask whether or not the sought-after medication is more harmful than the initial problem itself.  Additionally, he asks his readers to educate themselves on the harmful side-effects of medications.  He reminds his readers that we have grown too dependent upon medications, including the easy-to-obtain over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen and acetaminophen.\n\nHe writes, \"Having blind faith in pharmaceuticals is more than just dangerous -- it's naive.  Why would we ever think that medications can cure illnesses that develop as the result of a lifetime of bad habits?  Why would we look to a pill or a potion to dig us out of the physical or mental hole we've been digging, sometimes for decades? ... We're not overweight for lack of diet pills.  I have never seen someone with type 2 diabetes cured by a medication. ...  Sometimes we're sick because for many years we've lived unhealthy lifestyles and thought we could get away with it.\" (p. 29)\n\nIMPACT: After reading \"Medicines that Kill\" I was challenged in my own right to consider whether or not it was truly beneficial to consume vitamin I (Ibuprofen) as much as I do.  I have various aches and pains from years of beating my body at work and in the gym.  But after reading that one of my trusted stand-bys Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's) and Acetaminophen can be just as damaging to my liver as other doctor-prescribed medications.  The problem, is that these easy-to-obtain medicines (cold and headache medicines, for example) are just that: easy to obtain and uncontrolled.  I will reconsider next time I have a head or chest cold, or when my body aches.\n\n2 PARTS: The book is divided into two practical parts: The Problem, and The Solution.  The Problem tells the obvious issues associated with over-medicating, while The Solution presents his biblical approach to medicine.  He teaches a system of 7 laws -- good nutrition, exercise, water, sunlight, air, rest, and sabbath -- that he found tucked away in the 7 days of creation in Genesis.  Theologically, I found the 7 laws to be very loosely connected to those 7 days of creation, but \"Medicines that Kill\" was not intended to be a theological -- nor a scientific -- treatise.  Regardless of one's beliefs, Marcum appropriately encourages his readers to take control of their lives, to start focusing on right solutions, and eschewing the harmful ones.\n\nREADABILITY:  The book is easily readable by us medically untrained-types.  It's not a scientific treatise one would find in professional journals.  Marcum admits the scientific data and research are not there, but experience and logical observation supports his premises.  The stories are multiple and enlightening.\n\n\"Medicines the Kill\" is a new book that ought to be read by at least one member of every household.  Dr. James Marcum is the co-host of Heartwise Ministries.\n\nRATING: I give \"Medicines that Kill\" 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this book free of charge from Tyndale Blog Network (Tyndale House Publishers) in exchange for my unbiased review of it.

I found the book very difficult to follow as the time frames and characters jumped back and forth. Further, it was confusing to keep track of the characters as the author used nicknames, titles or given names interchangeably. That's a lot of characters, titles, given names, geography and time frames to keep track of. Lastly, I thought the superior vocabulary of the author was used excessively.

Big, fat ugly tears mixed with snot and crumpled up tissues.\nI didn't realize how much I missed having a soul cleansing read. Lisa De Jong blew me away with her writing skills.\nThis story is about losing yourself but also learning to trust again. It's about loving someone so deeply and completely that they make you want to be the best parts of yourself to share with everyone around you.\nIt's also about loss and longing and learning to heal.\nI had no idea what I was in store for with this story but it has left an imprint on my heart and I will be forever thankful that I had the pleasure of experiencing it.\nThis story starts with Kate, who is young and carefree, and trying to fit in.\nShe finds herself in an indescribable situation that leaves her left with only a shell of who she used to be.\nTrying to understand why his long time best friend suddenly changed and doesn't connect with him anymore, Beau is left feeling defeated but needing to move on to college to live his life.\nBeau loves Kate and has opened up to her about his feelings, only to be pushed away and feeling empty.\nThe day comes for him to leave his hometown and the girl he wants more then anything. He promises to come back every weekend and visit but Kate wants him to move on and experience life without her holding him back. So you can only imagine his hurt when he comes home and finds his quiet Kate finally smiling but in the arms of another guy.\nAsher Hunt is new to town and running from his past and hiding from a secret.\nNow mind you by this time you're totally swooning bore Beau so it's hard to hear when Kate pushes Beau away to only open herself up to this stranger that she's heard nothing but negative remarks about.\nHowever, Kate finds herself trusting Asher and opening her heart to him because she can sense that he holds a lot of his own demons in his closet which helps her relate.\nAs weeks progress and time moves forward, Kate begins to fall deep for Asher. He has taken her bad memories and replaced them with only good.\nHe has also slid his way into your heart and made a comfortable little spot so when the times comes and Asher reveals his secret, your heart stops beating and you fall to your knees with your head in your hands asking why.\nMoving from his life with his mother and sister, Asher has come to live with his father to spend the rest of his days dying in peace. He wasn't expecting to find Kate, the girl who he couldn't stay away from, or the love he thought he'd never get to live to experience. The pure connection that Asher and Kate have is so beautiful and all consuming.\nTheir love for one another is deep and raw. They have open their hearts to one another and have learned to heal together.\nAs the time comes when Asher begins to take a fall down hill with his health, Kate finds herself clinging to all the moments she can get with him. She's learning to live for what they have in the moment and not the inevitable of what the future holds and the life she will have to face without him by her side.\nAsher has shown Kate that she is strong enough to live again and has given her a second chance at finding herself again.\nThe day comes when Asher takes his last breath and Kate is left feeling lost again but she vows to move forward and push herself because that's what Asher wants for her.\nBeau comes back from college and she realizes she's ready to let him in and tell him about the night that changed her life forever. Once Beau hears Kate's story, he finally realizes why she's pushed him away for so long.\nThroughout everything Kate has always loved Beau but she was to afraid to let him in only to be rejected by him when he learned that she was no longer the same girl she used to be.\nBut Beau being the amazing guy he is, this only makes him love her more.\nSo yes, there is a happy ending but damn, I was not expecting the heartbreaking ride that the story took me on.\nThis story will break your heart into a million pieces but it will also put it back together again.\nIf you haven't read this book, you have no idea what you're missing.\nAn unforgettable story and by far my favorite read of all time.\nThis book will stick with you and leave you craving more.\nI can't express enough how much I needed this read.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I truly admire the author's ingenuity and seemingly limitless creativity as she takes the reader on an action-packed, mystical ride to Armageddon one book at a time.

Through mass media, he is brainwashing the masses robbing them of their joy, hope, love, and light and replacing it with self-destructive thoughts; inspiring murderous and heinous intentions against mankind.  In an attempt to draw the Guardian teams out of hiding to finish them while they are battle fatigued, the Darkness is scorching the earth with uncontrollable forest fires, flooding cities, destroying lives and farmlands with volcanic eruptions, tornados, tsunamis, etc.\n\nIn the meantime, it seems like Carlos and/or Damali will never learn from their previous mistakes - and it is Carlos (again) that blows their cover.  Carlos's well-intentioned blunder compromises their location and they are soon on the run (again) seeking safety in Detroit with civilians (children and elderly) in tow.  Meanwhile, Lilith nurses the damaged Anti-Christ chrysalis back to health.  Elizabeth Bathory resurrects her first husband, Dracula, to exact revenge on Sebastian for causing her horrifying disfigurement.  Dracula, instantly celebrated and elevated to a day-walking Councilman, leads the affront against the Neteru team. The direct and indirect results are devastating for both sides, particularly for Carlos; but it does nothing to stop the prophesies as the infamous and dreaded Pale Horse emerges from the depths of Hell.  The End of Days is quickly approaching and the team is scrambling to regroup (again).\n\nAt its core, I found this book to be yet another episode where the Neteru team appeared to be clueless and in a reactive stance for most of the novel.  It is a familiar scene that we have seen repeatedly before -- they are either under-equipped, outnumbered, and/or experience an epiphany at the VERY last minute - just in the nick of time to save themselves.  At best, Carlos and Damali's leadership abilities are still questionable (my opinion only): Their overactive libidos have resulted in an \"unplanned\" pregnancy at what appears to be the worst time ever (however, I'm sure the Light will prove otherwise).  They appear to have no proactive plan and continuously rely largely on instinct (and luck) to save their team -- they just seem to be fumbling and stumbling; making it up as they go along.  The rebuilding of the Neteru team literally introduces so many new characters that I am finding it difficult to keep them (and their abilities) straight.  Honestly, in this episode, I found Damali and Carlos's drama and angst well, quite frankly - boring.  Sorry - but the pregnancy subplot is not working for me and there were just too many pages of team member introspection and their personal reflections.  These elongated passages of \"fluffy\" dialogue really did not seem to advance the story.  It was the \"bad guys\" that kept me turning the pages. Lilith, Elizabeth, Dracula and the others were much MUCH entertaining and easier to follow in all aspects -- they are a smaller, devious group which makes it easier track their interrelationships and group dynamics.  Their endless bickering, twisted (but clever) antics, and ruthless plotting (against the Light and each other) along with their uncanny resourcefulness kept me engaged.\n\nReaders: Fear not -- there is enough of the fan-pleasing elements of steamy sex, urban grittiness, and diabolical plotting to keep die-hard fans happy.  Despite the shortcomings I noted, I enjoyed the book; but compared to others in the series, it was more of a challenge for me to complete.  As mentioned earlier, I was and I am still a fan of the VHL series - I am looking forward to the next release to see where we will go next because I am committed to the series until the end.\n\nReviewed by Phyllis\nJune 19, 2008\nAPOOO BookClub\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

In The Forbidden, the battle of good and evil continues, picking up where the last novel, The Bitten, left off. In this episode, the team is splintered, deeply wounded, and exhausted (mentally, spiritually, and physically).  Their faith, confidence, and fortitude have been challenged during the last battle that literally took them to Hell and back.  Damali, herself, is wounded suffering from a terrible loss of her child and seeks direction from the Light.  In a desperate act, Damali, is summoned to the Council of Neterus.  It is here we gain history and insight into the fates of the Neterus that came before her - including the first, Eve.  It is also where Damali must answer to her despicable and damning walk on the dark side with her lover/husband, Carlos Rivera, as detailed in The Bitten.  She is counseled and disciplined severely. She is sent back ashamed, weaponless, separated from her team, but with a better understanding of the magnitude and recklessness of her lustful behavior.\n\nShe begins a slow and confusing road to redemption and must now reunite and rebuild her team, avenge her past sins, and regain favor and trust of her enlightened mother-sisters.  She must assist the resurrected Carlos in his transformation to become her equal counterpart, the male Neteru. They must put their egos aside and discover their destiny together while battling their most formidable foes to date:  Carlos's sire (Satan's son) and Satan's wife (Lillith) who has stolen something from Damali that is more precious than life itself.\n\nThis novel allows us to bid farewell to a few familiar characters and introduces fresh allies and enemies, discover new powers and abilities, and reinforces the purpose and vision for Damali and her team.  It offers a wonderfully imagined blend of ancient folklore, mythology, religion, and culture that works brilliantly.  Bank's creativity yields an epiphany for Damali and her readers because there were many \"a-ha\" moments.  The plot is intricate and suspenseful, the characters numerous and complex, and timing is superb - great writing all around.  The Forbidden sets the stage for more action, romance, and mystery - it is a wonderful chapter in a fantastic saga.

It was about a beautiful young girl who was trapped in a life without happiness. She self medicated and fought with her boyfriend in a world of listlessness and aimless lack of purpose. One encounter in her life up until death was touching, her connection with one of her pupils. The young boy reached out to her and she was able to resonant warmth to his questions and desire for nurture. This was the only time that we see her get in touch with love. When she goes to meet with her boyfriend things again get dark. In a stormy nite, in frustration and rage she ends up in an accident. Earlier in the day she had went to a funeral and met up with a creepy director who followed her with his eyes. She wakes up in the basement of his funeral parlor, where he seems to be working on her white deathly pale body. He talks with her and tells her she is dead and that he can communicate with those who are in the afterlife before the transition. He has such disregard for those who die without the love of life and reeks contempt toward her. It is uncertain if Ricci is really dead, she doesnt believe him and this could be denial or it could be the truth. She breathes onto mirrors and it shows her breath warm the glass. Is it true, could  her death have been faked. Her boyfriend and her student wrestle with this thought. Something inside of them urges both to try to see if she is really dead before her funeral. Was it her spirit calling out to them from the place of pre transition or was it their intution. The movie reflects her process with the ongoing struggle with life and death. She reflects back upon her life and trys to reconnect with the realness and playfulness she had once shared with her boyfriend before time marched on in her polished unhappy life. Everything was perfect but not inside. The undertaker is able to see her flacid attempt at escape and lack of motivation to gain back her unlived life. The ending is eerie and somewhat ghoulish, the undertaker takes the small student under his wing using his innocent need for attention to turn his imagination into twisted fixations of burying someone alive. Ricci doesn't seem to find closure nor does her boyfriend in this freaky film with darks and reds.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It really helped clean up the mess and organize a lot of stuff that was in piles on the desktop.\n\nThe product is sturdy.  Putting it together was remarkably easy.  Most of the pieces just connect together using little wood dowels (that you dip into water to activate the glue on them).  I was worried about the stability of the unit right up until I added the back onto it.  The back uses metal screws and really adds stability to the entire unit.\n\nThe two shelves at the bottom can be converted into 4 smaller shelves for holding papers.

I bought it for my wife to keep her busy while I logged hours in front of the Xbox 360.\n\nI bought Order Up for my wife as a birthday gift.  I feel bad that three days later, she's logged about 45 minutes at the controls, and I've beaten the game at 5 hours, 59 minutes in.\n\nThe game is simply that addictive.  From the first burger you make until the last visit from the food critic at \"Chez Haute\" restaurant, you will not want to put this game down.\n\nYour first reaction might be to think that at 6 hours, this game is very short.  This isn't untrue, but this is a game that better rewards the casual player.  In my course through the game, I served less than 10 \"non-perfect\" dishes.  I refused to serve \"good\" food, and instead would throw food away multiple times until earning a \"perfect\" score.  Also, by mastering the art of spicing (which is clearly defined within the game) I was able to generate upwards of $200 per table served, and would end a \"work day\" with over $800 in the bank.  Because of this I was easily able to keep my spices stocked, hire the best employees, and upgrade my kitchen very quickly.  As a result I made money very fast, and progressed through the game with lightning speed.  My wife on the other hand is not nearly as perfectionist, and is satisfied with serving Good or OK dishes.  This can end up making for a longer play through the game.  I say this as a good thing though - this game will entertain her much longer than it did myself.\n\nMany reviews from gaming sites gave less than satisfactory remarks on the controls, saying that everything except folding burritos or omelettes worked well.  This is simply not true.  Every motion with the Wii control can be easily learned and skillfully mastered.  From flipping steaks to cutting swordfish to tearing lettuce to folding crepes - I could earn perfect every time.  Speed is the key, and some careful precision \"aiming\" with the remote helps.  Also, note that in the instruction manual it states that the \"nunchuk\" attachment is not needed, but adds some redundant controls to ease gameplay.  THIS IS VERY TRUE!!  The control stick on the nunchuck offers quicker ability to scroll through your cooking stations instead of having to leave the 'A' button on the remote and reaching the D-pad.  With the nunchuk connected, I drastically reduced my meal prep times.  I could serve a four-guest table in less than 2 minutes.\n\nWhat makes this game so much more fun is that you are responsible for running a business.  At the start of every day it's up to you on how to spend the wares of the previous day.  You may want to unlock some new dishes, hire a new assistant cook (you have a limit of two,) purchase the recipe for exclusive \"chef's specials,\" or - and this was always important - stock up on spices.  You could also upgrade various aspects of your kitchen, making appliances work quicker, making grills and stoves cook faster, or even make you knives sharper.  In some regards this made the game more challenging because it's harder to juggle three cooking stations when they all cook faster!  In the end, you spent nearly as much time outside of the restaurant as you did inside, and both areas were equally entertaining.\n\nI will agree with others that the game could have used more depth and length.  Another restaurant or two would have been nice.  A two-player mode would have been fantastic.  I personally would have liked to see more \"mature\" patrons at the nicer resturants - I got tired of the guy wearing a soup-can hat and farting on my surf-and-turf dinner...  The only real dissapointing part I felt was the \"delivery guy\" who could bring you super fresh meat or seafood, or fresh, \"organic\" vegetables.  The downside was you had to pay $1 to call the delivery guy, then when he showed up, had to pay upwards of $10 to pull a slot-machine handle built into his delivery truck, only to not win anything at all for your troubles!!  After this happened 5 times in a row, I never called the guy again.  There should have been a better reward system implemented to make this work.  But obviously it wasn't needed to enjoy or complete the game.  Lastly, I could not earn a perfect score on my pizza because the game wanted you to place pepperoni in some perfect pattern without any clear explanation.  That, as a perfectionist, simply drove me crazy.  Luckily I cooked all of 4 or 5 pizzas through the entire game.\n\nOrder Up was a very enjoyable experience that I look forward to continue playing even after I have beaten the game.  I think that in itself says all that needs to be said.

On a bankrupt farm in 1913 Montana, her mama and papa are struggling to eek out a life while Cora is away at college. Returning home for the summer, Cara has big dreams for her future. But she finds that her parents are barely making ends meet and have heavily borrowed so she can go to school. When a family member suddenly falls ill she has no choice, but to work sunup to sundown to keep the farm alive. Cora has no choice but to give up her dreams to be a teacher to take care of her family.\n\nBut in the story strongly reminiscent of Cinderella, a stranger arrives at their door with the news that Cora is not who she think she is. Pulled away into the fascinating world that is made of unfathomable riches, half siblings, and a father she didn't know she had, Cora faces the biggest challenge of her life. Who is she?  Who is she meant to become? But more importantly - why?\n\nFollowing Cora and her family as they are on a Grand Tour is exciting, and pumped my veins with adventure. I am such a homebody, but this novel inspired me to see the world for myself. Reading of Cora's struggle to fit in, to try to make the best of her circumstances is beyond commendable. She may be a fictional character, but Bergren has crafted a woman that will long remain in my memory.

And her overbearing, obnoxious mother who really isn't doing a thing by constantly matchmaking her to the local grocer, is unknowingly fueling Rebekah's dreams for life outside of  their tiny town in Oklahoma.\n\nSo when the opportunity arises to care for an estranged, ailing aunt in Texas, the same place where Arthur is stationed, Rebekah jumps at the chance to go help. Making great plans to aid her aunt back to health quickly, then rendezvous with Arthur at his base, she is so sure that her great life adventure is about to begin. But when she arrives, things change quickly with the Spanish flu epidemic and an unexpected situation involving four children. Will she be able to put her dreams on \"hold\" long enough to keep Arthur's interest and still fulfill her obligations to her aunt?

However, be that as it may, THE INFORMATIONIST is a very compelling read in an of itself. Although the early pages felt a bit perfunctory and lacking some detail about how Informationist Vanessa (also called Michael or just Essa) actually does her job, once she began her mission to find the missing young woman, Emily, and returned to Africa, the novel was very hard to put down. Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea don't often appear as locales in popular fiction and I was very drawn in by Steven's ability to describe the environs, the people (both native and not), and the hair-trigger political and economic situations. Most of all, the book really came alive when Vanessa reunited with someone from her past and the two worked first on personal rapprochement and then on dealing with the arrival (again) of another -- Vanessa's assigned partner, mercenary Miles Bradford. Vanessa becomes a person with whom one can empathize as she navigates the mortal bodily dangers and the pains and confusions of the heart.\n\nThe plot is perhaps too easily guessed concerning certain facts, but Stevens does pack a few wallops of surprise too. Still, for a woman who is supposed to be such an expert at collecting, sifting, and analyzing information, Vanessa comes up a bit short; she should have been able to pinpoint at least one perpetrator earlier.\n\nVanessa mentions -- but not in too much detail -- that she was raised in Africa by missionary parents from whom she is now estranged. It is worth noting that author Stevens had an apparently even more radical childhood: the thumbnail sketch of her on the back cover notes that she \"was born into a religious cult and raised all over the world before breaking free of the movement.\" Other Internet sources explain that the cult in question was the Children of God (now called Family International). Other well-known members at one time in their lives include, River Phoenix (and his siblings), Celeste Jones, and Rose McGowan. Grim allegations of child abuse have been leveled at the organization, and by her dedication in THE INFORMATIONIST -- \"To my fellow childhood survivors - you know who you are\" -- Stevens makes clear her own early life was one she wanted to escape. By creating Vanessa Munroe, a woman with problems but also with exceptional power arising from her need for control, one can theorize that Stevens is using as catharsis Vanessa's living with and trying to exorcise her oft-felt-or-mentioned psychological demons.\n\nBut author analysis aside, THE INFORMATIONIST is a welcome addition to thriller fiction. Lisbeth Salander's story was cut short (the late author had intended ten books), but, fortunately, now along comes Vanessa Munroe, and you don't want to be on the receiving end of her fury and acts of vengeance either! Stevens is already writing volume two in her series, and I am already looking forward to it. This first volume is definitely recommended.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Although the narrative reveals many complexities -- such as an amazing array of aliens with exceedingly distinct biologies and natures, as well as intricately developed plotline -- one has to strain to translate what is on the page into a flowing \"mental movie.\" The characters speak in shorthand a lot. And descriptions of critical events can be ambiguous or vague. Reading these books is somewhat akin to arriving at a bridge across a chasm made of wooden slats where random planks are infirm or missing and one has to uncertainly tiptoe over certain sections and jump across others. The books also take their own sweet time in many a scene -- i.e., the languid reconnection between heroine biologist Mac and her wayward (but also heroine) friend, Emily, in REGENERATION's opening chapters -- and that can lead to reader impatience.\n\nHowever, the strangeness in the prose also companionably enriches the trilogy's theme of a human scientific woman's unasked-for immersion in extraterrestrial species' evolution, competition, and, yes, maturation cycles. Mac's struggle to stay on her bridge over the chasm (so to speak) -- or perhaps one should use the analogy \"keep her head above water\" since she administers the Norcoast Salmon Research Facility -- when she must deal with various races of the galactic Interspecies Union is keenly transmitted to the reader. So is her scholarly social awkwardness with her own kind, and her slowly blossoming romance with the mostly-absent cosmic spy, Nik. It takes reader investment to fully appreciate these SPECIES IMPERATIVE books (just as it does to know and imbibe a fine wine), but all three volumes are worth the effort.\n\nREGENERATION brings the perilous and yet, often comedic, mission of Dr. Mackensie Connor and her earthly and unearthly friends (Oversight and Fourteen are among my favorite friends; they are each gratingly adorable in their own inimitable ways) to a nail-biting finale and a resolution that a salmon-cycle researcher would find befitting. This isn't a stand-alone though. Read the trilogy in order.

In a revealing and powerful essay he himself wrote for the release of this film on DVD, found in the DVD case insert, he talks about how grueling it was to make it.\n\nThe story of two murdering grifters with mining experience--enough to get them jobs in any one of hundreds of mines that sprang up after the demise of the Communist economy in mainland China--Blind Shaft pulls no punches in portraying the day-to-day existence of dirt-poor, working class men and women who scrabble for a living, waiting in the streets of the city, the village, the town, for work to come along.  These two, Tang and Song, have developed a vicious plan to make money--find a poor, unsuspecting man, have him pose as the nephew or cousin of one of them, take the man with them to the next mine that needs workers, descend the shaft into the mine, kill the third man and make it look like a mine cave-in, then, in essence, blackmail the mine owner into paying funeral and related expenses to the two of them for the \"accident\".\n\nThe editing in the film is what sets this apart from many other films.  The filmmaker, one can tell, is a master editor, absolutely brilliant.  There's not one wasted shot, not one extraneous cinematic moment.  The story is lean and mean, and so is the editing.  Interestingly enough, this is, as well, reflected in the acting; Yang used mostly non-professionals to portray the characters in the film.  This lends the work a jarring realism that one wonders would be there had he used professionals.\n\nWhen Tang and Song recruit a 16-year old, Feng, as their next victim, things do not go exactly as planned.  One of the two killers, as it turns out, has slightly more humanity running through his polluted blood than the other.\n\nWinner of several awards at various international film festivals, Blind Shaft is a riveting work of cinema that should without question have a much wider audience.  This is truly superior filmmaking.  Thanks to Kino for finding and releasing this powerful film.\n\nVery highly recommended; one of the best Chinese films in the last five years.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

While some efforts are being made to address the horrific situation of pre-teenagers working under dangerous health conditions in the Bolivian silver mines, nowhere near enough funding is available to prevent this enormously saddening practice from continuing.\n\nThe sight of miners--boys and men alike--walking maskless in and through clouds of mineral dust is truly horrifying. Then when you realize that some of these boys are as young as 12 years old, it's even worse. This scenario, when juxtaposed with miners praying to various statues of the devil--most festooned with flowers, food, and other items of thanks--is almost too bizarre to be believed, especially given the devout Catholicism of the population. But in the mines of Bolivia, the devil is, for better or worse, the chief deity--it is he who holds sway over the daily lives of the miners who, if they live past the age of 40, are considered lucky indeed.\n\nThe main character in the film is a 14-year old boy who with his 12-year old brother works in these mines to put food on the table for his broken family (the father is not in the household). He goes to school with his brother and hopes for a better future, but it's relatively clear, seeing the film, that this is really a dim kind of hope.\n\nThe Devil's Miner brings to light one of the most tragic plights of people living in poverty in various parts of the world. It's interesting to compare this with a feature film, Blind Shaft, set in China, about two miners who perpetrate a murderous scam to make money additional to their work.\n\nThis is a superior film, very highly recommended.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.43}, {"id": "21230", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis book was one of the few I haven't read before and I was so excited when I got my copy. :3\n\nWhen youve read a few of Felices books before you know she can also write grumpy, arrogant character and Asher Davis in this book is a  quite unique one. If you think Micah from Memories of the Heart is a heartleass, egoistical guy at the beginning of the book you haven't met Asher. :D\n\nI admit I was a bit astonished by Ashers behaviour. He isn't charming neither is he warm or lovable BUT only at the beginning. Also his appearance is different. His suit at the beginning is quite a remarkable first description of him.\n\nOur pitiful Doctor, Dr. Drew Klein, is a different kind of guy Straight  obvious when he was married to a woman  but totally unhappy with the relationship. His first description isn't really appealing, but he has his own character and this is developed soon. :)\nYour heart went imidiately towards the doctor, you also notice the witty character behind the shell, the broken appearance. And he is able to confront Asher and reply to his ugly, sometimes despiseful words he sometimes throws. Both are proud character, both are really confident, but different.\n\nAs I said, Asher is a really interesting character, he is aggressive and very strict  uses his words to defend himself, isn't tired of telling others he doesnt care of their judgement. He doesnt care if hes seen in an alley together with a lean guy, getting a blowjob or bang with one of the beautiful but without substance guys in a toilet stall.\n\nHe isn't a monogamous kind of guy, truth he doesnt do any relationship, neither show affection, love nor compassion, those are quite uncommon things for him. His taste for spicy guys, not dull (in fact they are), boring vanilla kind of guys is totally different from the vision he have of Drew  the straight doctor  in mind. He assumes the doctor won't ever agree with a one night stand, of course not, since he isn't even gay. But this doesnt stop him trying to seduce Drew.\n\nThat behind Ashers dominant and vibrant appearance a broken soul lies is soon revealed. It is shocking what you read about his past, what he had to endure and how he suffers from this. He has also a brave heart, a kind heart actually, though you would never expect this. He is also a guardian, a protector, but feels he failed In a drama you would call him the tragic hero, and he is one. A proud man, who holds his head up high, sometimes too high, but who is really unfortunate because of his sufferings in the past. The cover shows two guys and I think it captures Ashers broken soul perfectly.\n\nHe is also a guy with old fashioned sense, displaying this with the suits and neat clothes. You never see him with casual clothes. But also his taste in using only white sheets is very meaningful.\nIt is quite a contrast to see he is using the pure white linen but is banging a random guy in the quiet corner in the streets or in toilet stalls. But all these aspects are very well explained and make totally sense. And they break your heart. :(\nHe has also well manners towards older women like Drews grandmother Esther. It is really revealing and I admit I am more into analysing Asher than Drew though this guy is also interesting.\nTheir chemistry is really palpable, Drew is interested in Asher, he cant keep himself away, is well aware that Asher is a guy. And he was only into women.\n\nThis book by Felice Stevens has so many layers, and if you thought youve revealed one the next is around the corner. You are captured by the character, by their sufferings, as well as the one by the major and minor character equally. Esther for example is a hell of a lady, Asher is right to tell her a great lady.\n\nI was really emotional broken afther the book but my heart was set together again.\nI keep this book in my heart, it has heart clenching moments, more than one tragedy but also deep feelings. The erotic scenes are also as sensual and great as always.\n\n5 out of 5 stars.

The realness in the words, the sufferings of the character and the sometimes harsh words they spoke are honest and raw.\n\nKade knows how to shape his character that they are pleasant but with full of edges, nothing is really smooth about them. The rough and heavy things the character in general but also this two guys of this book show are remarkable.\n\nJeremy and Carter truly set themself in your heart. You are eager to get to know these guys, you are captivated but the rough words, by the behaviour towards the other person in the book and what happened.\n\nJeremy is one character you have to decode first, but under the surface there lies so much, so much depth but also vulnerability. Its incredible how well you like him after a while.\n\nCarter is a differnt kind of guy compared to Jeremy but nontheless he is interesting. He hasn't the obvious edges like Jeremy but he isn't also pure innocence, despite the fact he developed his feelings late for Jeremy.\n\nA lot of mixed feelings are in and between the book, a lot of angst is built on this and makes things complicated. Though the title says Simple Things there aren't any of them for a long time but even with all the heavy aspects the book has a really cute and charming happy end after. :3\n\nIf you love realness, honesty and rough character you will love this book.\n\nJeremy and Carter have a chemistry which is undoubtly, which is settled and you know both fit well together though they seem so different.

The Wolves of Twin Moon Ranch Series\n\nThe Wolves of Twin Moon Ranch is well worth purchasing and reading especially if you enjoy wolf shifters. The author does a great job giving us something new and different to enjoy as well as pulling us deeply into the lives of the characters she has created. I highly recommend this series and you cant go wrong with this box set.\n\nDesert Moon - 4.5 Stars\nALowe is an awesome writer. I was pulled into the characters, plot, and world from the first to the last page. I could not put Desert Moon down. The emotions are so real and the world is unique. I also like how the shifters are portrayed. We are also given a great conflict on more then one front with the feud and rouges. Ty and Lana are a perfect couple. They complemented each other and when they connected the sex was passionate and sensual. Desert Moon was fantastic, the storyline was gripping, and the characters are captivating. I am riveted and blown away.\n\nDesert Blood - 5 Stars\nI LOVED return to the Twin Moon Ranch pack. I was blown away and sucked in from beginning to end. I like how ALowe brings her characters together. She has a way of getting the reader hooked into the emotional journey the characters take. Cody and Heather complemented each other perfectly and the way their relationship develops was fabulously done. The story flows, with a rich sense of scenery and world building. Desert Bloodis an Amazing and Fabulous read.\n\nDesert Fate - 4.5 Stars\nDesert Fate blew me away. I was captivated by ALowes characters and the writing. Stefanie and Kyle complemented each other completely and I loved how their relationship grew and changed from friends to mates. I felt for Stef and her situation. Nothing was in her control and Kyle is the only thing that was keeping her grounded, but she does not fully understand yet why. I also felt for Kyle. His frustrations, his fears, and hope that maybe Stef is that one and just maybe they can belong and make a home. The plot was small, but significant enough to add tension for everyone and also shows us that not all packs are good. Desert Fatewas such an amazing read. I was captivated with the emotional journey that Kyle and Stef go through and how they finally found a place to call home.\n\nBonus Scenes: SPRING HOLLOW - Takes place midway through the epilogue of Desert Moon. Ty & Lana are a sweet couple. I love visiting them. Here we get to see a private moment, just a little down time between these two away from the pack, so they can wind. It's sweet and short. Just another wonderful moment in their lives giving the read more to enjoy. A DESERT VALENTINE - Takes place just after Desert Fate.. We get to see Kyle and Tina. It's sweet, short and adorable. What Kyle does for his Valentine gift was perfect. This short reminds us to slow down and enjoy our time and those we love. We also get a glimpse of Tina and how lonely she is; before her story in Desert Heart.\n\nFans and new readers will enjoy these adorable bonus scenes.\n\n*Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy free of charge for each individual book from Anna Lowe with the sole purpose of an honest review.

Some wealthy men are buying up the rest of the island to build a resort. The resort appears to be an answer to prayer to help them save their home. Then in comes trouble, or so Audrey thinks, in the construction contractor Marshall Graham, the son of her father's former drinking buddy. When \"accidents\" start happening around the construction site both Audrey and Marshall wonder who can they trust and what are God's plans for them. This is book 1 of the Bridal Veil Island series by Tracie Peterson and Judith Miller.\n\nWith the combination of mystery, romance, drama - To Have and To Hold never had a dull moment. With a diverse range of characters from a cranky southern-to-the-core \"aunt\" to a widowed doctor - Peterson and Miller had a lot of personalities to combine for conflict, drama, friendship, and romance. Some of the novel, like the romance, was pretty predictable, but I'm not sure how that could have been changed since we were seeing the story through both of their eyes. The suspense around the construction site filled the story out and will give the book a broader range of interested readers. Also, there were enough twists and turns, enough misunderstandings and stubborn personalities to keep it interesting and charming. Honestly I've always cared more about the story than about the historical accuracy.

Gone are the mediocre, uninteresting, and occasionally flat-out awful songs that marred the two previous discs-this album is crammed full of fun, exciting, and ultra-obscure mid-60s rockers from Southern California.\n\nSome of these songs are among the best garage rock records ever. The Dovers' \"She's Not Just Anybody\" should have (and could have) been a chart-topping smash. It is, simply put, a masterpiece, a haunting, emotional burst of chiming guitars and dreamy vocals, bolstered by a relentless river of percussion. The Starfires' tense, throbbing \"I Never Loved Her\" is almost as good. Same goes for \"She Needs Me,\" a hypnotic fuzz rocker courtesy of the Grains of Sand. The Rumors' \"Hold Me Now\" is positively anthemic, thanks to its rousing, \"Louie Louie\"-inspired melody and exuberent vocals. The Cindermen's \"Don't Do It Some More\" is a relentlessly catchy twist rocker that features a wonderfully off-the-wall guitar solo. Terry Randall's \"S.O.S.\" is a spooky, paranoid protest tune with a subtle, smoldering lead vocal and a churning rhythm. The Gigolos' \"She's My Baby\" is a storming, double-time punk-rocker with a strong rockabilly influence, and the Humane Society's \"Knock Knock\" is a fiery, snarling tune with some thorny guitars. The Cloudwalkers' \"Sunglasses\" is insanely cool, and the Bush provide a fantastic version of \"Got Love if You Want It\" that features some compact but explosive rave-up sections. The Green Beans' \"Who Needs You\" is every bit as sneeringly sarcastic as its title suggests, and The Beckett Quintet's \"No Correspondence\" is a quietly insane bouncer with an anthemic chorus. The Caretakers of Deception close out the album with driving \"X+Y=13.\"\n\nThe afformentioned tunes are only a few of the highlights of this spectacular disc, one of the finest entries in the entire Pebbles series.

It's the innocent, joyful, and sometimes hilarious antecedent to Nirvana, and we should all be grateful for it.

And, until the recent biographies on James Polk, the presidencies between Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln have held little interest and garnered few words written about them.\n\nThe times were remarkably fast moving and the politics were fascinating.\n\nRobert Rayback brings Millard Fillmore to life in this biography written in 1959.  This fine treatise on the life of our thirteenth President shows a temperate, skilled and reasonable man.  Fillmore was a man of destiny, ascending to the Presidency upon the death of Zachary Taylor.  Had it not been for the death of the Whig party concurrent with this, he may have spent more time in the Oval Office.\n\nThere have been eight men who have assumed the Presidency without being elected.  Few, if any, could have, or would have been elected on their own.  Yet, many, if not all of these men brought their own voice to this position of leadership.  John Tyler was a strong presence in the White House.  Harry Truman, a quick decision maker, and a man whose broad knowledge of history guided him.  Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to establish a strong foreign policy.\n\nFillmore brokered the Compromise of 1850.  He envisioned this to be a lasting solution, in which slavery would die a slow death as the country gradually took on the economy and the values of the North.\n\nStephen Douglas played the heavy in shattering this vision by undermining the Kansas and Nebraska compromises to include slavery.\n\nMillard Fillmore is generally thought of as a footnote in our Presidential history.  An obscure non-entity whose name elicits sly laughter.  This book takes a different look at him.  He was a man whose Presidency found its way and its voice.  He was a man who understood what he wanted, and brought honor and respect to the office, much like another man of destiny, Gerald Ford.\n\nA fine biograpy, and an interesting read.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

From this perspective reading this book was a failure.  I felt like the last guy on the block to get the joke, as I didn't realize this was a spoof until I got about fifteen pages into the book.\n\nBut the author doesn't stop at miligning only Fillmore.  He chooses a large array of targets, and the early 1800's are one of the funniest.  He describes life in that time in such a way, that I often was laughing out loud.\n\nThe footnotes were often hilarious.  In talking about the electoral college, he raposts \"the fact that classes ...convene only once every four years has led to its reputation as a party school.\"\n\nOr a hamlet-\"To qualify as a hamlet a community had to have at least one unique superstition founded on either sneezing animals, the consumption of meat before sleeping, or the flight of sparrows on a windy day.\"\n\nOr Fillmore himself-\"It has largely been suggestedby presidential psychiatrists that Fillmore suffered from the verbal phenomenon known as 'cognitive ignorance'\".\n\nThe author brings Fillmore to life in much the same way as a creation between the historical soldier Flashman and Forest Gump.\n\nOpening Chapter 7, the author quotes Fillmore \"Buffalo in the springtime, is as I imagine heaven to be, although with more precipitation and fewer cherubs.\"\n\nThis hilarious and often inane depiction of our 13th president kept me laughing.  He intersperses his imagination of what the anti-hero is really like with the historical events of his times.\n\nInterestingly enough, revisionist historians now take a much more moderate view of Fillmore.  He is considered to be a temperate president who took a studied conciliation between the abolitionists and the pro-slavery factions, and averted an earlier civil war.\n\nThis book is often cruel to Fillmore, even maligning his wife's death, the day after he left office.  While the events that Fillmore encountered are for most part factual, the author makes some bizarre interpretations.  If they are read in good fun, it is worth the read.\n\nIt is worth a perusal, but read it when your mind is clear, so you can fully appreciate the bizarre humor of this author.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.64}, {"id": "21262", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nOne of my very best purchases.

Weaver II, Ph. D.\n\nBefore you read this review you must understand several things.  First, I am not a strong advocate for any of the books in the Chicken Soup series.  Second, I am a believer in a positive life, and thinking positive about anything should a natural and automatic part of living, not something saved for a particular illness, problem, or situation.  Third, I find that prayer serves no purpose whatever.  It may be useful to buoy your spirit or give you hope, but chances for a positive outcome because of prayer are 50-50, just as they are in life without prayer.  And there are no such things as miracles.  Fourth, all thoughts and feelings occur in the brain -- not in the heart.  You cannot be guided by your heart, have a nagging in your heart, or have a broken heart.  Sorry.  The heart is merely a muscle that pumps blood.\n\nAlso, and this is just an aside.  Anecdotal evidence (stories, examples, personal experiences, and illustrations) count for little in the course of life.  There is no doubt that they have persuasive power because of the way they stir the emotions and can rally people to act.  But with respect to proving something (there is no doubt that God exists), or serving as a basis for argument, they have no -- zero -- evidential power.  The experiences detailed in this book are personal, highly subjective, and told with a bias (slant or angle) that can easily cause readers to question their true veracity.\n\nThen why did I pick up this book?  Curiosity could explain it.  I write positive essays, and even my publishing company, And Then Some Publishing, is based on a philosophy (carefully explained at the website) that is founded on the idea that you must do everything that is required of you in life -- and then some.  It is the \"and then some\" that is most likely to bring you recognition, rewards, riches, and success.\n\nOne more answer as to why I picked up this book is simple: I am always in search of additional ideas to write about.  At my blog, I write a 1,000-word essay every week, and this is my fourth year (over 200 essays!) of writing them.  I thought that with 101 inspirational stories in this single volume, surely I would find one or two that would stimulate a unique thought, a useful memory, or a new essay.  I was wrong.\n\nNow, you might think -- from this introduction to this review -- that I found the essays boring, unnecessary, inappropriate, irrelevant, or worthless.  No such thing.  Most are very well written.  Their writers tell a compelling story in great detail and always with a positive outcome.  Just as in all the Chicken Soup books, if you want short inspirational essays, there is no doubt about it, this is a good choice.  They will cause you to closely identify with the writers and, in many cases, appreciate human determination and perseverance.  (I always think to myself, \"Damn! what some people have to endure!\")\n\nOn the other hand, I found the essays rather repetitive, so I do not recommend readers read the book from beginning to end without stop.  (It can be read quickly.)  Put it somewhere where you can read it in short segments, just as I think it is intended.\n\nI want you to know that I admire any book that causes readers to feel better about themselves or better about the human race in general.  If a book such as this gives people hope, then it has served a useful purpose.  If it helps people put their own life in perspective (by comparing theirs with others in worse situations than their own), then I think it is valuable.  And, if it makes readers \"rage, rage against the dying of the light,\" as Dylan Thomas expressed it in his famous poem, \"Do not go gentle into this good night,\" then, perhaps, it should be read by everyone.\n\nI have reviewed over 250 books, and I did not realize that I had reviewed this book previously.  On July 23, 2011, (about 8 months after my first review) I reviewed it a second time.  Although there is some of the same information in my second review as there is in the first, there is a lot of additional information.  Without any tailoring or deletions, the following is my second review of this book.)\n\nI have been delighted with many of the Chicken Soup for the Soul books, but not in the way many of those reading this review would suppose or imagine.  My first goal in selecting this book was to find potential topics, themes, or ideas to write about on my own positive-oriented blog at Andthensomeworks.\n\nFor the short, inspirational stories, of course, this is not unlike most of the previous books of this genre (although a number of reviewers at Amazon.com suggest this selection is not as strong as others).\n\nThere was an unexpected byproduct here, however, similar to the one I experienced in reading my father-in-law's (Edgar E. Willis) book, How to be Funny on Purpose: Creating and Consuming Humor.  What I discovered from reading the Willis book, because of its clear, accurate, and detailed explanation of how to create humor, I found myself engaged actively in the process of writing jokes.  I had never written jokes previously nor did I think myself capable.  What fun I had constructing them!\n\nWell, in reading about \"thinking positive,\" I went through a number of epiphanies.  I couldn't help myself.  I thought, for example, about what a positive and pleasant life I have led, and why it has happened.\n\nThe life I have led, both by design and positive thinking, fortunate (and lucky) decisions I made along the way, and certainly circumstances that have provided opportunities I never dreamed could happen, has been challenging, exciting, rewarding, and incredibly satisfying.  Many of the results of positive thinking occur because of good choices along the way!\n\nHere is my conclusion regarding positive thinking.  All of life depends on making good choices.  So, if I were to give advice to anyone (as I have done to over 80,000 students during my teaching career), it would be this: Prepare yourself in such a way that you (not someone else) is in control over the decisions of your life.  Study harder, work smarter, and adapt quicker.\n\nNow, I fully realize this is easier said than done and, too, that no matter how much we prepare, we cannot be in total control over all the decisions of our lives.  That is true, however, that should not be discouraging.  The point is to prepare as widely, broadly, and thoroughly as possible----stretch ourselves in all possible directions----in order to give ourselves the edge, the opportunity, or the advantage in any decisions that affect (or impinge on) our lives.  We do not (cannot) know what curve balls life will throw at us, but that does not mean we cannot prepare ourselves to meet them.\n\nWhen you apply this philosophy to your life, you are always looking for ways to improve, expand, or extend.  You never stop learning or, even more important, looking for ways to increase your knowledge and potential---and the neurons in your brain.\n\nThis is the philosophy, I believe, that best undergirds, reinforces, buttresses, supports, and strengthens positive thinking, or it is the most likely philosophy to bring positive results from positive thinking.  Positive thinking alone is valuable, but it takes more than just positive thinking to bring concrete results.\n\nI found this Chicken Soup for the Soul book useful and valuable in this regard.  I realize that teachers seldom know the impact---long-range results---of their instruction, but if I instilled this single idea in any of my 80,000 students I taught over more than 30 years in the classroom and lecture hall, I would consider my work successful.  It is more than just a positive message, it is a charge, command, or instruction that, when internalized and practiced, will send you on a mission to take responsibility for your life.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There is an 18 page bibliography (pages 279-297), and there is a 138-page \"Sources and Notes, Clarifications and Amplifications\" section (pages 139-277).  There is no index.\n\nJust a note here on the \"Sources and Notes. . .\" section: Shenk uses 134 pages of text to make his case, and it is engrossing reading.  But, if you think \"Sources and Notes\" would be a long, tedious, boring section of the book, you would be sadly mistaken here.  For each and every assertion that Shenk makes in his argument (we'll get to that in a moment), he has a source or note to verify it.  This is a highly researched, evidence specific, thoroughly developed argument that is worth every minute you spend with it.\n\nIf you are looking for a motivational book that will support all that you do in life, this is where to start.  If you think for one moment that you are limited by the genes with which you were born, think again.  Shenk claims your genetic heritage may account for only about 50% of your talent, and the other 50% is determined by nurture and your environment.  What you do, and how you feel about what you do matters.\n\nIf I was looking for support for all of the motivational essays, speeches, articles, and books I have written throughout the years (See, AND THEN SOME WORKS), this would be the book -- and the evidence.  What Shenk is saying is that the intensity of your motivation, ambition, persistence, and self-discipline are not genetically determined but are shaped by nurture and environment.  Just as you teach children how to take responsibility for their lives, you, too, can have a direct, sustained, ongoing, positive, and productive influence on your own talent and ability.  This is good news, and if you don't believe it, read this book, and bathe in the evidence that supports his assertions.\n\nAll of the books that have been (and are being) written on neuroplasticity -- \"[the] term referring to the ability of the brain and nervous system in all species to change structurally and functionally as a result of input from the environment\" -- gain support from Shenk's work.  Shenk makes the case for the plasticity of intelligence.\n\nShenk explains how genes really work, that intelligence is a process not a thing, that talents are not innate gifts \"but the result of a slow, invisible accretion of skills,\" as well as how to be a genius, how to inspire children, how to foster cultural excellence, and how to improve your genes.  This is an amazing book!\n\nHaving been an advocate of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work on flow, I was delighted to find Shenk referring to Csikszentmihalyi: \" . . . intelligence isn't fixed.  Intelligence isn't general.  Intelligence is not a thing.  Intelligence is a dynamic, diffuse, and ongoing process.  This finding fits perfectly with the earlier work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and colleagues, who concluded that `high academic achievers are not necessarily born `smarter' than others, but work harder and develop more self-discipline'\" (p. 42).\n\nWhether you are a supporter of the interactionist perspective or not, the book will introduce you to the way genius is made.  That is especially interesting to read.\n\nI think the author made a superb decision to separate his argument and the evidence used to support his argument.  He is an excellent writer, and 134 pages may be all you have to read.  I have found that the more technical you become by incorporating all your evidence and references within your narrative turns off more readers than it encourages.  Shenk's argument is so well presented, so smoothly offered, and so effective that it should be readable by a large audience -- especially, I might add, educators.  Educators are often those prone to picking out and doting upon their brighter students.  After reading and absorbing what Shenk has to say may make them think twice about this approach.\n\nThe use of examples such as David Beckham, Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods, as well as Friedrich Nietzsche, Beethoven, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was delightful information.\n\nBecause of Shenk's argument, and because of his emphasis on the interaction between genes, nurture, and environment, I loved the following paragraph: \"For deliberate practice to work, the demands have to be serious and sustained.  Simply playing lots of chess or soccer or golf isn't enough.  Simply taking lessons from a wonderful teacher is not enough.  Simply wanting it badly enough is not enough.  Deliberate practice requires a mind-set of never, ever, being satisfied with your current ability.  It requires a constant self-critique, a pathological restlessness, a passion to aim consistently just beyond one's capability so that daily disappointment and failure is actually desired, and a never-ending resolve to dust oneself off and try again and again and again\" (p. 55).  Talk about motivation to excel!\n\nNow, after writing a paragraph like that, Shenk offers a realistic assessment of what it takes to excel: \"It also requires enormous, life-altering amounts of time--a daily grinding commitment to becoming better.  In the long term, the results can be highly satisfying.  But in the short term, from day to day and month to month, there's nothing particularly fun about the process or the substantial sacrifices involved\" (p. 55).  Do you wonder why the information in this book -- even when read by those seemingly committed to change -- is likely to go in one ear and out the other?\n\nOh well.  Even if you are familiar with the ideas here, even if you wave off social-science research as bogus, and even if you believe that talent comes primarily from genetic inheritance, this book is a good read.  Shenk makes you think -- and that's a healthy thing to do whether you agree or disagree with him.  Five stars out of five!\nScore:"}], "output": "5\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 4.55}, {"id": "21272", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nSo this book was really good up until the point when they finally get their big romantic scene...and it turns out to read like a really bad porno. The story itself was engaging and suspenseful and I was connected to the characters from the beginning. I just couldn't believe it culminated in a sex scene that was neither romantic nor hot. The author works in a number of positions and acts but there is absolutely no emotion, no chemistry coming from the couple. The relationship had reflected a lot of sweetness and devotion up until then, to have it so tawdry just felt completely wrong. I wound up skimming the last few paragraphs of the lengthy scene in order to get back to the story, only to discover that that was it. The author leaves us with a bunch of questions and unresolved issues from the actual plot. The claim that this isn't a cliffhanger is definitely not true. It's also not an HEA but instead a HFN.

I first discovered Brookner years ago when I was living alone in a tiny flat. I was unemployed at the time and the days were long and empty. I could relate to her heroines who exist on the margins of society. Since then Brookner's books have held a perverse fascination for me, although I can't say I've ever actually enjoyed any of them. It's hard to enjoy reading about sad, lonely people with very limited horizons.\n\nFraud is no different from any of Brookner's other novels I've read. The main character, Anna Durrant, has devoted her life to caring for her ailing mother and she's at loss after her mother's death. Now in her early fifties, she's never worked or had a serious relationship and has few friends or interests. The few people she does know pity her or look on her with contempt. The book is set in the recent past, yet the characters belong in the nineteenth century. For example there is an understanding between Anna and the family doctor, Halliday, that at one time he seriously considered her as a marriage prospect, despite the fact that they've never spoken about anything beyond her mother's illness or been on a single date!\n\nIn true Brookner style Halliday is stolen away by a flashy younger woman who uses her feminine wiles to entrap him. That's the big problem I have with Brookner's books - women are divided into superficial bimbos who get the man and intelligent, plain women who lose out. There's a real puritanical hostility towards sex, and relationships between men and women are portrayed in a very simplistic way. Halliday realises too late that he has been led astray and that he is stuck in a miserable marriage. He yearns for a solid, decent woman like Anna who reminds him of his mother.\n\nMen don't fare much better than women in the book. They are either too weak to resist a predatory woman, or they're predators themselves, out to ensnare needy women like Anna's mother who are also undone by their desire. Ironically the central idea that comes across so strongly in this book and others by Brookner is that a woman is nothing without a man. Being a wife and mother are seen as the ultimate achievements in life, and women who fail to win a mate and reproduce are destined to be social outcasts. There's no possibility of a fulfilling career or other interests to overcome their loneliness and isolation. Her heroines wallow in their misery while doing nothing to help themselves. I wanted to shake Anna and tell her to get a job or do volunteer work if she was so desperate to be useful, instead of wasting her life on people like Mrs Marsh who clearly dislike her but are happy to use her whenever they need something. She is independently wealthy and can live wherever she wants to, but instead spends her time obsessing over insignificant people, analysing their every conversation and gesture.\n\nMrs Marsh is also a pathetic character who only comes to life when her adult son comes down with the flu and she finally has a man to look after. She makes no bones about the fact that she favours him above her daughter, and makes much more of an effort when he visits because he's a MAN. She supposedly worked for 20 years as a magistrate, which I think is Brookner's attempt to modernise the book by having a 'career woman' but she never mentions anything about her work, and was apparently still at home to kiss her husband goodbye every morning and greet him when he got home! When reading the obituaries she notes that occasionally she came across some of her husband's colleagues names, not her own colleagues, which I thought was telling.\n\nIt's generally accepted that Brookner's novels are based on her own experiences as a spinster who cared for her elderly parents until their deaths. She lives alone, is notoriously antisocial and has acknowledged her own feelings of loneliness. What you could never guess from reading her books is that she was the first woman to hold the Slade profesorship at Cambridge university. This very successful career in the public world finds no echo in her books which are set in claustrophobic private worlds of repressed women. I get the impression that despite her achievements she sees herself as a failure for never marrying and this is explored through her heroines. At the end of Fraud Anna does find some backbone but there was no real build-up or character development leading to this moment so it seemed inauthentic.  Brooker also gives nod towards feminism right at the end in the form of a female doctor at the surgery who doesn't confirm to her usual virgin/whore stereotypes and may even be a lesbian but it was too little too late for me.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

(The stereotype of the lonely spinster bothered me at first, but I was willing to let it slide because of the interesting twist of the main character falling in love with a whole family).\n\nNora begins to believe that maybe there is still a chance that through the Shahid's she can somehow fulfil her dreams and have the interesting life she always thought she would. She allows herself to get swept up in these fantasies until reality inevitably intrudes and she is forced to face the truth about her own neediness and delusions.\n\nNora has more spark than most of Brookner's heroines and she is a much more well-rounded character. I can't really understand why so many people think she is unlikeable. It's clear that in her outward life she is a decent person with friends who care about her and students who adore her. We, as readers, get to see past the faade she puts on for the world, and into her darkest fears and obsessions. Who among us would come out smelling of roses if our masks were stripped away and our true selves revealed?\n\nOne of the things I like best about this novel is its psychological realism. Nora to me is a very believable character and this is far more important than whether she is likeable or not. Her ambivalence about what she wants from life has been shaped by her mother's repressed anger at her own stifled existence. In trying to avoid her mother's fate Nora created her own cage, in the same way that she creates tiny boxes in her art. She lacked the courage to pursue her dream of being an artist, but at the same time she knows she is too honest to fit into the pretentious art world that the duplicitous Sirena slides into so easily. She is on the margins in every sense and Messud has done an excellent job of exploring the rage and impotence of a woman \"of a certain age\" who finds that she is becoming invisible.\n\nThere's much more to this book than this though, and I'll be mulling over its themes about art and identity and gender for a long time to come. The ending when Nora decides that she is no longer going to be the meek \"woman upstairs\" was very un-Brookner like and I was glad to see her finally own her rage. It finished on a note of hope that Nora is going to live life on her own terms and find the hidden symbol of joy that was always there in her art works for those who looked closely enough to find it.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.68}, {"id": "21285", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nIt's an okay bumper case with some flaws.

Note that almost nothing is ever written about the Corp Sector, but there it is on the NJO maps of the galaxy.  Also, AC Crispen wrote his Han Solo trilogy in a manner that accommodates Han and Chewy's trip to the CS.\nI have placed this trilogy on the timeline at -4.9 BNH, taking place between The Hutts Gambit and Rebel Dawn (books 2 and 3 of the HST).\nThese are the first known non-Lucas novels of the SW universe.  I am not sure whether they actually pre-date the SW comic strips, but surely Daley is the real father of the EU.  If you are a Han Solo fan, this trilogy is a must addition to you library.

Alex is the lover and sygkenis of Michael Cyprien (see IF ANGELS BURN for their story).  Lucan and Michael are enemies who have been pitted against one another for years by their father and leader of the Darkyn, Richard Tremayne.\n\nMeanwhile, Lucan meets Fort Lauderdale Homicide Detective Samantha Brown who is investigating a murder that occurred near his club.  Lucan is drawn to Sam as she reminds him of his previous love.  Will Lucan's dark side prevent their love from being fulfilled?  How will Michael handle Alex's kidnapping?  And don't forget the elusive Brethren as Alex's brother, John, will have to choose on which side he stands.\n\nDARK NEED is not a stand alone novel.  Despite having read the previous two books when they were released, this reviewer had to refer back to both books to understand certain plotlines.  The plot was almost too complicated for the length of the book and this reviewer actually put the book down for awhile in frustration.  There were simply too many subplots occurring, including but by no means limited to Sam's stalker and former partner, Wesley Dwyer, the hidden identity of Adam Suarez, the molting of Faryl Paviere, and the machinations of Richard.\n\nLynn Viehl is to be commended, however, for her ambitious efforts.  The Darkyn series provides a fresh approach to vampires and this is certainly welcomed by readers of the paranormal.  DARK NEED is marketed as a paranormal romance but is likely to appeal more to fans of dark fantasy or perhaps even horror as the romantic aspect is very grim.  Lucan is not a very likeable character (after all, he tries to dump Sam after kidnapping Alex in hopes of making Alex his sygkenis) and it was difficult to see him in the role of the romantic hero.  This reviewer will not yet give up on this series as she hopes that the author will eventually tie all of the loose ends together to present more of a cohesive story.\n\nCOURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

As his seneschal, she has done everything she can to keep him happy and content.  Byrne fears his darker warrior side, fears that one day he will snap.  Now, he is prepared to give up his role as suzerain after the tournament.  But someone else had very dark plans, plans that could destroy more than just Byrne and Jayr....\n\nLynn Viehl integrates the world of the vampire with tales of old to produce some very interesting results.  In EVERMORE, the myths and legends of Robin Hood and Sherwood Forest are explored.  At first, the emphasis on the past was a bit distracting, almost boring at times.  However, as the storyline built, it became quite intriguing.  The ending was exceptionally satisfying.\n\nJayr and Byrne are two of the more likable characters Lynn Viehl has created.  I initially enjoyed this series when it started with Michael Cyprien and Alexandra Keller, both of whom play a large role in this book.  However, later characters tended to grate a bit for me.  Jayr is by far one of Ms. Viehl's best characters to date.  Not only is Jayr willing to give it all for love, but she also refuses to be treated differently because she is a female serving in the traditionally male role of seneschal.  Byrne, too, is an excellent character, a man who struggles with his warrior nature and wants to protect others from himself.\n\nThe Darkyn series should be read in order.  Without a doubt, the characters and plotlines continue to weave in and out of the series and there are numerous things that only make sense when read in the context of the series as a whole. While some aspects of EVERMORE do stand alone, the complexities of Darkyn society and the various relationships are much better understood if one has read the prior books.\n\nEVERMORE is not a book that will appeal to all.  Lynn Viehl provides a unique approach to the vampire theme, one that is at times gritty and even quite brutal.  Lynn Viehl shows once again that she has a flair for taking chances with her writing.\n\nCOURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.61}, {"id": "21291", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nperfect for hanging artwork or ribbons on, without tack holes everywhere or greasy poster putty\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I put in 3 or 4 ice cubes in each bottle and let them sit in my kitchen at about 80some degrees for 3 hours. When I came back I dumped the contents out into cups to check how melted the ice was. The Nathan bottle was the clear winner with a chunk of ice still left over while the Polar bottle left a tiny sliver of ice that melted completely within 20 seconds in the cup.\n\nI found the Polar Bottle for $7 and the Nathan bottle for $8 in my local tj maxx store but I don't know if they're available anywhere else like walmart. I knocked a star because while I love that this bottle more than keeps my drink cold while my time in the gym, and I love the self sealing valve (which feels like nice soft silicone), it does produce a bit of condensation but nothing major. Also, it leaks a tiny bit, but again, nothing bad. Since it's still new, I do kind of taste a bit of plastic, but I don't mind. That said, I like the way it feels in my hand. The size is comfortable to hold.\n\nI will definitely be keeping this bottle and will return the Polar one, despite its bigger capacity. It's also cool that it's reflective. I do recommend this bottle and try to find it in stores first before you buy here and run your own experiment!\n\n*update* a few days later and I barely realized that the valve opens and closes! lol, the grey part with the arrows. If you want more flow, keep it open to the left, where the purple area on the cap shows an open lock symbol. close it to the right to shut it. Because of how the valve is, I don't need to close it, nothing leaks out even when tipped upside down. The way water comes out is by sucking it out lol!\n\nAlso, I don't really know why sometimes it insulates better than others. One day it took 5 hours for 8 ice cubes to completely melt. As you can see in the last 2 pictures, after an hour and a half, you can see how much ice was left. I guess it has to do with the outside temperature and humidity. My gym is in the lower 70 degrees, so that helps slow the melting. Yet another day, the 4 cubes melted at the end of my hour-long workout.

I liked \"Aaro\" in itself, especially how the book developed a plot beyond the hero and heroine's reservations about their relationship. That's done so often now in romance, it's almost a cliche. But, as with so many series I've read, it's hard for an author to keep up the pace and avoid creating inconsistencies as they go along.\n\nI didn't mention this in my review of \"Jett,\" but I wondered why a man determined not to procreate didn't get a vasectomy. Jett could certainly afford one. It's clear he's not avoiding fornication, and being as he was illegitimate himself, I had to wonder why he could be so confident he couldn't accidentally impregnate a woman. I wondered the same about Sebastian  though he said he wasn't opposed to being a father. In \"Aaro,\" we learn the reason. It seems God, who sent these men to earth to defend innocents, also gave them the benefit of being able to fornicate without fear of unwanted children or venereal disease. They can't get sick, and they can only produce children with their soulmates. How convenient for them.\n\nWhich leads to the unavoidable conclusion that, despite Olivia's claim that Gerard despised Valentina, she was in fact Gerard's soulmate. How sad that a man would detest his one true love. \"Jett,\" \"Sebastian,\" and \"Aaro\" all make it clear the woman can just walk away from her mate if she wants  unless she's had sex with him. That's what Jett tells Haven, anyway; that if she has sex with him, she'll be his forever. So while I can accept Valentina left Gerard for other men, I'm puzzled how she did it AFTER she and Gerard conceived Jett. Shouldn't she have been psychically his forever?\n\nAnd second, I'm cool with the whole \"one true mate\" idea. I mean, I don't believe it in real life, but that's usually how these paranormal romances are written. But again, taking that into consideration, I'm confused (and a little disgusted) by Aaro. When we met him in \"Sebastian,\" I thought he'd be my favorite. That he and Darcy were Christians right from the start was refreshing. But what was this with the double-standard? Not only did Aaro KNOW he was as good as married, he was taught sexual purity. So what's this with satisfying his lusts with Debra Parker, Patty Macy, and Linda Murray -- three women he KNEW weren't his soulmates and he would never marry? Unrepentant adultery? Geez, at least Sebastian recognized the wrongness of what he'd been doing, but our \"Christian\" hero, who should know otherwise, unashamedly admits to having screwed around before he met Darcy! I expected, being as Haven and Darcy were both virgins waiting for their intended, Aaro would also be a virgin. What a disappointment that the hero I anticipated as my most favorite turned out to be my least.\n\nEDIT: I borrowed this on Prime and thought I'd read it again before returning it. On doing so, I'm so repulsed by Aaro's infidelity and lack of integrity, I'm thinking Pratola may have lost me as a reader. I'm caught up in another series now, which I'm enjoying very much. Maybe I'll read Ulrich when I finish, but maybe not. It depends if I can get past my disgust with Aaro.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Now that I've started a different series, I was able to go back and reread \"Sebastian\" by itself.\n\nFirst, a caveat. This may be a Christian novel, but it contains language I know many Christian readers will find offensive. Just so you know what I'm talking about, I'll say there's one vulgar term for a male puppy, multiple uses of the three-letter word for a donkey, and one near-blasphemy where someone yells \"Jesus!\" but then saves it by following up with an exasperated prayer.\n\nNow, I had to ask myself, why did I give this novel four stars instead of five? I like the world Pratola's created, and I enjoyed the brotherly banter between Jett and Sebastian. I especially liked how Jett went about finding out what was wrong with Haven. Despite being a total control freak, he's a coward when it comes to his wife. He needed someone to put him in his place, and I was glad to see him and Haven end up together.\n\nBut Sebastian and Natalie...\n\nAll right. Putting all that \"soulmate\" nonsense aside (since it was totally blown out of the water in the third book), let's look at this in the light of normal human relationships. Sebastian is enslaved to his lusts and fornicates with multiple women, sometimes with more than one at the same time. No wonder Natalie is disgusted.\n\nThen he meets the girl who's supposedly his life mate, gets saved, and we're suppose to believe he's free from his addiction and completely trustworthy from that point on. But why should we? Natalie doesn't believe it. Something inside her (the Holy Spirit, perhaps?) warns her that once his initial lust for her is satisfied, Sebastian will return to his manwhoring ways.\n\nI think that's why I found this book so dissatisfying. Sebastian never does anything to prove he's reformed. We're suppose to accept it because it's what we're told. But all I'm seeing is a man with the hots for a woman he can't have.\n\nI guess there are some who can accept Sebastian and Natalie as a HEA. I'd like to accept it. But there's this thing niggling at me. That's why four stars instead of five. A five-star romance leaves me in tears of joy, and as much as I want to accept the ending of \"Sebastian,\" it left me with too many doubts to be truly happy about it.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.35}, {"id": "21311", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nVery good!

A tiny seed is entrusted to the care of the \"Nice Lady.\" The seed was a gift from a friend to plant in her garden. The friend said, \"This will make a beautiful vine with sweet-smelling flowers.\" But the seed did not believe that something as tiny as it was would ever amount to anything.\n\nWhen spring came, the Nice Lady prepared the seed for planting by soaking it until it became soft. Then she planted it where it would get lots of sunshine. She talked to the seed and told it she would see it again in the summer. In the meantime, the Earth spoke to the seed and said, \"God has planned something beautiful for you. You will be a green vine with blossoms that scent the air with sweet perfume.\" The seed still did not believe it.\n\nWhen summer came, the seed began to sprout and it pushed its way up through the earth. The Nice Lady came and encouraged it to climb the trellis she had bought for it. The seed couldn't imagine ever being able to climb the trellis. But the Earth said, \"Just start. The job is half done when you've made a beginning.\" The seed, of course, eventually grows to be a luscious vine with many fragrant flowers.\n\nAccording to the book jacket, The Trellis and the Seed is a parable about \"the rewards that come from being a little bit different from everyone else.\" I think it's more a parable about patience and faith. The author also cites this Bible verse from James 1:17: \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above.\"\n\nThe watercolor illustrations by Robert Gantt Steele are delicate, yet vibrant, much like the seed.\n\nWhat I Like: Everything. The language is poetic, the message is simple yet significant, and the illustrations are beautiful.\n\nWhat I Dislike: Nothing.\n\nOverall Rating: Excellent.\n\nAge Appeal: The publisher doesn't give an age range.

When the weather gets warmer, and her father is working in the garden, Maggie knocks the box off from the cellar shelf in her haste to get her gardening tools.

Several weeks later, when she wakes up on Easter morning, she finds out how special the gift really is.

I was virtually Reciting the lines that hadn't even been Said yet, but I Didn't See \"Driven\" for Ground-breaking Dialogue or Oscar-worthy Performances. I saw it for High Powered Car Races, Fast pace Thrills and to See Sylvester Stallone Back on Top. I got Everything I was Expecting.\nSly plays Joe Tanto, a Washed-up Formula One racer who is brought back by his friend Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) to Befriend and Help out his Troubled Hotshot Driver Jimmy Blu (Kip Pardue), who is Talented, Fast and Professional, but he's also Reckless, Young and in a bit of a Slump. He has lost the Love of racing because of all the Pressure that is on him to Win. His Manager Brother (Robert Sean Leonard) and his On-Off Girlfriend (Estella Warren) don't help his Stress Factor. Sly believes if Jimmy pulls together Off the track, he'll come together On it, so Sly has to Earn Jimmy's Trust and remind him why he began racing in the First place, for the Love of the Race. Yep, that about Sum's it all Up.\nThe Best Scenes include a Wild Joyride involving Two Prototype Formula One Cars and Downtown Chicago, a Car Flying through the air in Super Slow Motion, and of course, the Final Race. While a lot of the film concentrates on the Behind the Scenes stuff Formula One fans don't See, (like Handling the Pressure, how Easy it is for your Racing Career to Slip away, Relationships) Race fans are Still Treated to some of the Best Formula One Racing Ever captured on Camera, the Crashes, the Casualties, the Fear, the Sound... My god, the Sound.\nThe Sound is actually the most Memorable part of the film, both the Sound Effects and the Soundtrack are Mind-blowing. Renny Harlin Obviously knows how to use Music, and Every Race has a Different song that suits the Mood, even some of the Dialogue fits the scenes. (eg. Filter's \"The Best Things\" in the Chase through the Streets of Chicago scene)\nOverall, \"Driven\" is a film for Fans of Speed. Critics have attacked it's Rapid fire Editing and Lack of Development, but to Please the Masses, sometimes luxuries like Story, Dialogue and Development have to take a Backseat to Flashiness, Style and Sound. \"Driven\" is such a film, and I Loved it.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Both Mel and Sly make Their characters Far more Likeable, and in Doing so, they Lose what made the Originals Classic films.\nSly's Carter is a Vegas Debt Collector who heads off to Seattle when his Brother Mysteriously dies. He meets a Lot of Sordid Characters on his little Holiday, including Miranda Richardson as Gloria Carter, Sly's Brothers Wife, Rachel Leigh Cook as Doreen Carter, Gloria's Daughter, the Wonderfully Smug Alan Cumming as Computer Genius Jeremy Kinnear, Michael Caine (whose presence only reminded me of the Superior Original) as the Shadowy Cliff Brumby, John C McGinley as Hometown Henchman Com McCarty, the Criminally Underrated Mickey Rourke as Cyrus Paice and the Stunning Rhona Mitra as Geraldine, Sly's Link to the Underground. They all give Restrained, Mature Performances that Perfectly Fit the Feel that the film is aiming for.\nThe Scenes where Stallone and Rourke face off are worth Purchase Price Alone, I simply Could Not Choose who I wanted to come out on Top. They are Two of my Favourite Tough Guys. Gretchen Mol makes a Good Impression in a very small part. (an Extended Cameo that has Good Performances from her and Sly, but it Worked Better in the Original) Her scenes, as well as Rachel Leigh Cook's scenes, nearly all feature Sly, and they are the films Best Scenes, Acting wise.\nAction wise, the film is subdued. There are two well-staged Car chases that have been a little Over Edited, they still Achieve their Goal. Sly dishes out some Harsh Beatings, but the film never becomes a Full On Action film like Most of Sly's Resume. Fans of \"Copland\" should enjoy this, the two films share a lot in common, eg. Mood, Tone and Performances. In the End, the film is more of a Triumphant Return for Mickey Rourke than it is for Stallone... In my opinion, Stallone never left.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.83}, {"id": "21325", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI am tuff on belts.

The upper flap barely fits, but the longer you have the boots/shoes on, the tighter you can pull them.  There is nothing cheap about these boots because they have soft leather to make them fit better.  They are somewhat lighter than my white S/S boots, mostly because the sole is light and pliable.

I enjoyed every moment of \"The Quieting\", from becoming reconnected to the characters I grew to care about in The Imposter, to the new and lovable character of Abigail Stolzfus. The novel is crafted with solid pacing, and I simply couldn't get enough of this story as I devoured chapter after chapter! I think what most struck me in this book is how seriously the Amish take the issue of sin in leadership, as I fear that too often today in evangelical churches, members may just look the other way in a situation like what David's church finds themselves in, dishonouring God and his word in the process. David's obedience is to be admired, and the result of the \"quieting\" was precious to behold. In the midst of the serious issues dealt with in the book, Abigail added much enjoyed humour with her straight forward ways where she just says it the way it is. As she and Dane danced around the possibility of a relationship, I found myself rooting for them to find love. Dane's ability to be positive and to see the gem hidden beneath Abby's sometimes offensive exterior is to be admired! But out of all of the great moments in the book, it is the growth of David over the course of this story when he finds the courage to stand up for truth that I most appreciated. I can't wait to see what lies next for David in the coming book in the series!\n\nI was reluctant to turn the final pages of this book because I so enjoyed spending time with the entire cast of characters featured in this book.

Although this book would not be placed in the \"suspense\" category, I am not joking when I say that I found myself infused with tension, gripping the pages and barely able to refrain from rushing through the pages to see how things would resolve. Anyone who is a parent will see exactly what I mean as the plot unfolds! The author has woven together several different subplots into a unified whole, all set in a unique time in history I have never read about before. I was fascinated to observe people's reactions to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I kept imagining how I would feel contemplating the potential of nuclear strikes near my home. But I was most absorbed into the fate of Scott and Gina's marriage and the welfare of their sons. I found myself reflecting on the health of my own marriage and whether I am treating my wife as she deserves to be treated. Am I investing in my children the way I need to? Am I being the man God has called me to be? The author has succeeded at creating a story that left my heart racing, while leaving me pondering the deeper questions of life at the same time.

Sometimes international travel is required as well. I had an older travel adapter. But that was not the best because I had to carry around a bag full of adapters for different countries. That is very annoying but what was worse was that there was only one outlet. And that was the USA two-prong plug. Not the three as most laptops have it now a day. But this unit, it can handle the two-prong as well as the three-prong and it has two usb ports on the side so you can charge your phone or anything else you might want to. Word of caution to anyone that is using this for international travel. You can only plug in devices that can handle the 110V/220V output like a laptop or some hair dryers. This is not a converter as it is clearly stated in the product description. All in all, this universal adapter is a great thing to have when you are traveling. It can handle over 150 countries. And now we tend to bring more than a laptop with us, like a phone, tablet, ereaders and many more devices so the usb outlets are very helpful as well. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to get a universal adapter.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a reduced price so that I would give my unbiased honest opinion, which I did.

The unit does not seem to be much but it does do a lot.  Usb 3.0 is way faster than the traditional Usb.  I am able to move data without having to worry about the wait.  I am not talking about small couple hundred Mbs files but I am talking about gigs of data.  The unit itself is built strong.  I have not tried throwing it against the wall and I don't plan too either.  But from what I can tell it is pretty good.  The nice thing is that I has a small footprint so it does not take up much space on my table.  And not that I am a stickler about this but another positive not is it matches the paint job on the mac.  The only complaint I have the usb cable it comes with is pretty short.  I was hoping to put it at the corner of my desk but it is what it is for now.  Will probably look for a longer cable down the line.  Overall the usb hub/ card reader is amazing.

The costumes and sets were very nicely done, the location shots were breath taking, and the big name stars scattered throughout the program made it very enjoyable to watch.\n\nI cannot understand why this has never been released in the U.S.A., in any format.\n\nRecently I purchased this show from a Greek source. I don't know if that is different, except for the packaging, than the Netherlands release. It is in the PAL format, but a \"Progressive Scan\" DVD player will play the show on a US TV.  I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TRANSFER!  THE QUALITY, VISUAL AND AUDIO, IS POOR. THE NBC NARRATION IS MISSING AT THE BEGINNING. THE NORMAL BREAKS FOR COMMERCIALS HAVE BEEN CUT OUT IN A VERY UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER.\n\nHELLO? NBC, get your act together and offer this show to Region 1 in a high QUALITY manner!\n\nFrom the images shown during the opening credits and elsewhere, it is obvious that much of the filmed story was not shown in the U.S. I have always wanted to see the parts that were left out. I assumed they were used for international versions of the program. I was wrong. The promotional scenes at the start of each broadcast are chopped out in the R 2 PAL set I recently purchased. Very sloppy work!\n\nMy only complaints about the show are 1) the music becomes tiresome with constant repetition; 2) the color key is off: it is too red / amber - reversal of Cyan.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There's nothing of note here different than, say, the Brainwavz M5. You get the typical rectangle thin cardboard box with a window. RHA has decided to go with a black and orange color scheme and there's ample information on the box. The box opens up top with the headphones seated in a clear plastic housing with the tips right below it inside the carrying case which is made of black velour with a small tag with the RHA logo and a drawstring to close the top. As for tips, you're only getting a set of small, medium and large mushroom tips.\n\nBuild Quality and Design\n\nWhen I first looked at the MA-350 nothing caught my eye, in-fact my first impression wasn't good at all. They look cheap and I've had nothing but bad experiences with fabric cables. The housings are made of lightweight aluminum and are shaped in such a manner that doesn't look comfortable at all. The front part of the IEM is tapered down to a wide port that's protected by a mesh screen made of some sort of metal, while the back side appears to be made of black plastic with RHA stamped in light grey. Below that a rather long and flexible stress relief extends from the housing with a R or L embossed on the sleeve, but it's hard to tell sometimes without a closer look. The cable is fabric and in the past I've had nothing but bad experiences, from increased microphonics to terrible tangling problems. The MA-350 share the tangling problems, but not as bad as others I've used and I'm surprised that there's no microphonics problems, at least when worn over ear. At the y-split there's an RHA stamp and a simple sinch. The cables join as one here making a thicker cable and eventually terminating into a straight plug. Length wise I feel that these are perfect, I have no problems with the cable getting hung up on things nor is it too short to fit into one of my pants pockets.\n\nThe MA-350 only come with 3 pairs of mushroom tips, S/M/L, thankfully though I was able to get a great fit with the mediums giving a great seal and good comfort. The housing may look goofy, but there's no rub or irritation on my outer ear unlike what I've experienced with other IEMs that have semi-deep insertion like the MA-350. Microphonics are non-existent with the MA-350 worn over-ear, which is my preferred fit for these. Isolation is average here, without music playing I can still hear keystrokes and I can hear my feet hit the ground when walking, but when music is playing at a reasonable volume all is blocked.\n\nSound Quality\n\nI gave the MA-350 50 hours of burn-in and have been using them often for the past two weeks, with at least 100 hours of listen time. No significant burn-in was noticed, these are good to go out of the box.\n\nLows\nThe lows are where the MA-350 will beat many other IEMs in this price bracket and no it's not due to the quantity, it's due to the quality. To expand on that, the MA-350 extends down very low with good clarity and decent detail, in-fact I couldn't find a song that the MA-350 couldn't replicate in the sub-bass regions to a more than adequate level. The sub-bass has a nice presence and in certain cases a pleasant rumble. Two notable songs are The xx Fantasy and Kanye West's Monster, both songs have some strong sub-bass that will properly shake a car with a decent subwoofer. The MA-350 certainly don't have that power, but the sub-bass is strong and in Kanye's case even has a nice rumble. Despite good presence and strength unless the song calls for extreme sub-bass it finds a nice balance in it, such as in The xx song Islands which has a few deep sub-bass sections intertwined with the mids and mid-bass and compliments them well.\n\nThe midbass is done rather decently too, bass guitars are easy to discern in any decently recorded song and it's easy to pick out the notes thanks to the clarity in the bass. There's no muddling of the bass here that tends to happen on other sub-$100 IEMs, I'm looking at you Brainwavz M5. On the other hand I do feel that the midbass could use a little more punch to it and a bit more separation, kick drums give a little thump and toms sound pretty good, but I feel they need a little more authority and at times feel congested. You can't have everything though and at this price the bass is done nicely here.\n\nMids\nI'm a sucker for mids, a lot of the music I listen to is mid-centric so it was much to my pleasure to listen to the MA-350. The first reason I say this is because there is only a very slight bleed of the bass into the mids, but I'm being a pedant here. The mids have a great presence with a forward slightly aggressive feel to them. Vocals tend to be pushed most forward with rather good clarity, though there is a bit of grain even on excellent recordings. That hasn't stopped me from greatly enjoying stuff like Frank Ocean where the vocals and lyrics are the primary focus. The grain does detract a bit from the experience though and there's a bit more sibilance than other IEMs I've used in this price bracket. Still Sara Bareilles powerful voice sounds great.\n\nAside from vocals I've greatly enjoyed acoustic recordings as they have a very crisp sound to them. Fiddles, banjos, and acoustic guitars sound great, especially at this price range.\n\nHighs\nThe highs aren't the focus here, but there's good representation of them overall. Cymbals and hi-hats overall sound okay, sometimes feeling a bit distant in comparison to the rest of the drum set as do horns at times, especially when they are the instrument of focus. The highs are rather clean though with the horns having a light grain, but a nice full quality to them, most notably on Rubblebucket's Came Out of a Lady.\n\nSoundstage\nThe sound of the MA-350 is decent overall, good for the price, the problem is that the sound is a bit congested at times which takes away detail, causing instruments to clash and fight for space in the sound. There's not much depth or width to the sound stage which takes away from songs that rely on panning to envelop the listener. The sound isn't completely flat in depth, but there's not much to it and width wise I'm reminded of a local band playing in a basement. I've enjoyed music more that has little going on, the more layers added to the music the more congested these get.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe MA-350 can be had for $40 on Amazon right now and for that price I feel that they are a decent value, but I don't love them at this price. My biggest cons with these is the lack of accessories which could end in a poor fit and the narrow soundstage. Overall I feel the MA-350 are a good value though and if you have spare tips then these are worth trying and these make a great Christmas gift for your friend or family member who wants good quality sound at an affordable price.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I have spent enough time with them to feel comfortable sharing my opinion, but my experiences may differ from yours. Its always best to demo a headphone before purchasing, but if you're unable to I recommend at least reading other views in conjunction with this review.\n\nThanks to RHA for the review sample.\n\nBuild & Fit\nBuild\nThe RHA are wonderfully crafted in-ear monitors from top to bottom, coloring me impressed from the moment that they left the beautiful packaging. The housings are made of stainless steel with a barely visible line that joins the two halves. The nozzle is removable and unscrews easily by hand and is reattached smoothly in the same fashion. Each cable leaving the housing is clearly designated either blue or red for left or right, respectively, at the base of the memory wire. The cable itself is a tad bulky, but inspires confidence in the durability of it. Stress relief is adequate at the end of the durable looking straight plug, relieved by a metal spring rather than a rubber sheath. All of this is backed by a 3 year warranty, not too shabby.\n\nFit\nI find the T20 to be very easy to arrange around the ear as well as with inserting the nozzle into a secure position. The IEM sits at a moderate depth, but manages to block out a good amount of noise passively, more than enough to use in crowded college hallways. Comfort-wise these are a notch above every deep insertion IEM that Ive used, as well as much less picky about positioning to obtain optimal sound. I have these inserted and positioned in my ears in a few seconds per ear, with comfort and stability that allows me to wear these with no issues for the 2 hours at a time that I tend to wear them. The large variety of tips should ensure a secure and comfortable fit for most users.\n\nSound Quality\nOverall\nRegardless of which filter was used sibilance is apparent, the midrange is recessed, and the bass is overly prominent. Sibilance varies with filter tips and despite the bass being prominent the low-end leans tight and controlled. The filters only affect the upper-midrange and treble, thus leaving the bass to have a heavy presence without EQ. The driver is relatively free of distortion and the bass carries quite a thump with an overall sound signature being decidedly V-shaped with the exception of the bass filter. Overall soundstage presentation lacks width and depth, but has good left/right panning and positional accuracy.\n\nReference Filters\nI was excited to see the word reference as I have been looking for a neutral IEM to accompany my HD600. Unfortunately reference filters don't equate to a reference sound. Outside of the common characteristics of the overall sound, the reference tips offer the largest amount of sibilance and a moderate upper-midrange boost that gives the reference filters a moderate v-shaped sound signature. The sibilance was so much that I found Glory Box from Portishead and I Cant Feel My Face from The Weeknd to be completely unlistenable.\n\nI don't think that RHA intended reference to mean reference quality sound, rather reference in regards to the variety of filters.\n\nTreble Filter\nI had reservations after listening to the reference filters. I was scared that these would be even more sibilant. Somehow thats not the case, despite the treble being raised. This filter adds further presence in the upper ranges, further increasing the v-shape to a rather heavy v-shape. Sibilance is still present though and theres a bit of grain added compared to the reference tips. Nothing else has changed, only the uppermids/treble are affected with the filter change so its not a shock.\n\nBass Filter\nThe bass filter offers the most linear midrange to treble balance of all of the tips while providing a large amount of bass. There is a slight veil due to the prominence of the low-end, but the driver controlls the low-end rather well. Sibilance is reserved, there seems to be some brightness inherent in the drive but I don't find myself wincing on snare hits as I did with the reference tips. I find this filter to be the most enjoyable of the three, especially with hip-hop, due to the relaxed upper frequencies and powerful bass. Despite me enjoying this filter the most, its nowhere near an all purpose tuning. This tuning reminds me a bit of the HyperX Cloud and DT770 Pro 80ohm.\nConclusion\nOverall the T20 is a v-shaped IEM that DT770 owners would want to consider for portable use. They offer 3 filters that change the presence of the higher frequencies for those that want a tweak to the sound without using software EQ. Build quality, a massive amount of tips, and comfort are the strong points here, all backed by a 3 year warranty.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 4.28}, {"id": "21347", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nLove this case, the bling and the pink is me.

If you are already acquainted with Tarot, forget it.  The beginning is interesting, relating Tarot to numerology and astrology, etc.  But the main focus of the book is the deck of cards, right?  Then why are the interpretations so general and shallow?  They consist of key words and phrases bunched together and thrown into your face.  No guidance.  No insight.  I think this author may lack reading experience, so the cards are just a series of factoids to research.  Which is cool, if you are just vaguely interested in Tarot.\n\nIf you truly want to experience the Tarot on a deeper level, I recommend Mary K. Greer's and Brigit Esselmont's books.  Brigit is very intuitive and detailed.  She has a website called \"Biddy Tarot.\"  Her e-books make this book look like a pamphlet.  Not just in size so much as in clarity, profound insight, and specificity.  I do not get how this author could fail to put as much thought into his writing.  Dumping key words is silly because each card should speak to you in an intimate way, I find.  \"Biddy\" Esselmont's books give you a general interpretation of each card, then relate each card to health readings, finances, spirituality, relationships, etc.  So you can take her in-depth interpretations and relate them clearly to your issue or concern.  She shows you how the meaning of each card reflects the same concepts differently in each type of reading, which I find very helpful.  Greer's works are all very thoughtful and thought-provoking--even academic in nature.  So, skip this one and check out Biddy and Greer.

This book is a presentation of relevant information and beliefs that you must choose to integrate into your understanding of the cards (or push aside for now).\n\nWhat this book does well is bring to light a fascinating array of connections and valid ideas about Tarot in general, and specifically suit by suit, card by card.

If you terrify easily, this film is not for you. Well-acted, but the screenplay lacks polish. It's trite, but could have been kind of acceptable with a few tweaks. Screenplay had ZERO consultation from police, I think it's fair to say. There is a pivotal scene where the cop's (Cusack) daughter is portrayed as too blatantly stupid. A very small change in the degree of recklessness shown would have added more cred to the story and more sympathy for the character. Another small mess-up that is emblematic of the lack of thoughtfulness in the writing, has to do with poor investigation technique where the detectives don't actually investigate a witness statement, they accept her opinion as fact instead of easily checking her assertion. It would not have taken more time or cost more money to shoot it more responsibly. Things get a little worse at the end. I have no theoretical problem with the crazy twist, BUT it is done really lame. Not a lot of effort would have had to go into a re-write to make it kind of workable. I feel bad for Cusack. I mean he got paid, but this kind of film can hurt your status. HIS performance is fine, and contributes significantly to making the film watchable.

He has written books on the politics of the era, biographies of some of the era's leading figures and is the case here, he has written battle histories. This book like the author's other offerings is clearly written and concise, easy to understand and read and most importantly, it is not dull. Many authors offer up books that are just full of good information but reading them is like reading the Biblical book of Leviticus. Heaven only knows just how many well intentioned people have attempted to read the whole Bible but have come to a dead halt upon reaching Leviticus. The same applies to history books which go into such mind numbing detail about every movement of every regiment and company that the reader finds themselves completely lost and frustrated. Davis, with his wonderfully chatty writing style avoids this problem while still giving the reader all of the pertinent details.\n\nDavis begins his story with Fort Sumter where the reader meets General P.G.T. Beauregard, the first major player in this story. Beauregard of course becomes the \"hero of Sumter\" and goes north to Virginia with a high reputation and an even bigger ego. Davis is not kind to the Creole general in this book and in fact may be just a little too harsh. As the story progresses the reader is also introduced to some of the people who will be major players throughout the war. This view of men like Jackson, Ewell, Early, Sherman, Stuart and Burnside will certainly help the reader understand events shaped by these men later in the war and each of these men are destined to play a major role over the next four years. Davis does an excellent job of hinting at the future of these men and also pointing out little habits or quirks that are going to become important as these men rise in rank and stature.\n\nAs with any well-written book, Davis builds the suspense as her works his way toward the battle. Actually, more of this book deals with the preparations for the battle than with the battle itself. Beauregard, who had an excellent eye for building defenses chose his ground and fortified it well. If the Yankees had just done what he expected them to do the battle would have been over in a very short time. The much-maligned Irvin McDowell had put together an excellent battle plan and Davis offers a pretty rousing defense of McDowell in this book. Davis clearly shows that had McDowell had a little better support and a little better luck, things might have turned out much differently. Besides being completely new to this type of command, McDowell had to deal with a President who was playing politics with his army and a General in Chief who not only disliked McDowell but was also playing political games. Then there was General Daniel Tyler who almost single-handedly destroyed McDowell's plan in a bid for individual glory and also General Patterson who's sloth and caution allowed Joe Johnston to join Beauregard before Patterson even knew he was gone.\n\nDavis does a marvelous job of setting up this battle and then does an even better job of describing the action once it all begins. He has set the whole thing up so well in fact that the narrative of the battle needed very little explanation for everything made perfect sense because of the set up. This situation allowed for the story of the battle to flow about as smoothly in this book as in any book I have ever read.\n\nThe only real fault I found in this book was the maps. The maps were good but they were a little small which required me to put on my specks and there were too few of them. There are also several typos that should have all been weeded out in this revised edition and the publishers need to correct this problem in any future editions. Still, this is an eminently readable and highly enjoyable account of the first major battle of the Civil War. Well researched, well written, and highly informative, what more could anyone ask?\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There are so many positives to be found in this book that I don't think I can list them all.  On the other hand I didn't find anything at all that I would consider a negative.\nGeneral Alexander wrote this book for his family at his daughter's request.  She wanted to be sure that they had a clear record of the General's role in the war.  Since Alexander never intended for this to be published, it is not written in the deep, dry, and dull formal Victorian style.  Instead it is written almost as a long letter to his family and is therefore easy to read and understand.  I spent several long nights, well past my bedtime, engrossed in the General's story.  That seldom happens with a dull book.\nAlexander's having written this for his family is also a plus in that he is entirely honest.  He has no ax to grind, no score to settle, and no point to make.  Many civil war leaders, both military and civilian wrote memoirs after the war.  Unfortunately, most were written with the idea of aggrandizing themselves or proving they weren't at fault for a particular failure.  Longstreet for example, wrote an excellent book but he spends all too much time trying to defend himself from the vicious attacks that were being launched on him.  There is none of that here.  Alexander calls things as he sees them.  For example he heaps praise on General Lee for the most part, but where he finds fault, he says so.  There is also a great deal of praise for General Grant to be found in these pages.\nFinally, in various capacities Alexander was in close contact with the Confederate high command throughout the war.  From First Bull Run to Appomattox Alexander was there.  He was with the Virginia Army in all of its major efforts and was with Longstreet on his trip to Tennessee.  Seldom can one find this kind of insight into both of the Confederacy's major armies.  There are amusing tales, stories of the hardships faced by the common solider, and touching reflections on Alexander's last meeting with some of his comrades who were killed in battle.\nDo not pass this opportunity up.  This book is an enjoyable read and is full of insight.  If any book belongs in a well-stocked civil war library, this one does.  Alexander probably did as much service to his native south with this book as he did during four years of war.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.13}, {"id": "21364", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nFall Away was another great book in this series.

So often, when I receive a gift copy of a book for review, the book turns out to be a disappointment.  Even if the plot is ok (a 50/50 chance its only a sort of \"preview\" of a book), there is often a cliff hanger at the end (upsetting) or a lot of editing errors.  That is not the case with this book.  This one was an excellent.  I understand previous reviewers' comments about Christian being abusive, etc., however, we have to remember, Christian is, himself, an emotional mess.  He has lost his whole family and received a crippling war injury resulting in constant pain.  He winds up coming home and taking over his father's newspaper, which he has no interest in doing.  He has a LOT of issues.  Then there's Jenny, who is a Jane Doe locked in the hospital and labeled a lunatic.  When they first come in contact she is receiving water treatments intended to induce fear and panic that is supposed to somehow help her.  Christian is mortified at this treatment, while not realizing at the beginning that this is the woman he is there to observe at the request of his friend, a doctor.  When he tries to help her and to let her know he will be coming back for her, she turns the tables on him and he winds up locked in and strapped down while she steals his horse and runs.  Later,  the horse returns to his stable with Jenny still on board, but she is nearly frozen in the winter weather.  Christian makes sure she receives help and the whole household staff take her under their wing.  Christian realizes he has inappropriate feelings for this woman and does not want her around him but she has no place else to go.  Jenny has even more issues than Christian and neither knows how to deal with the attraction they begin to feel for one another.  Throughout the book, the whole plot is to find out who Jenny really is and why there are people who wish to hurt her.  She does not feel she can trust anyone enough to confide in them because she thinks they will think she really is a lunatic.  It takes most of the book to find out what is really going on, who she is and why she's had such a hard time.  This turns into a sweet love story when both Christian and Jenny realize what they have in each other and manage to build trust between them.  I loved the story and the fact that all loose ends are tied when the story is finished.  I loved the writer's style and there were few places in the book that needed editing.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I think it fits perfectly with the story. Now let me also say I had no clue what a tag chaser was and had to google it to find out as I started to read. I have lived around a military base all my life and never heard this phrase or some of the other ones that came up when I searched it so I learned something new. Lol.\n\nAs far as the book. I did love it. I absolutely loved Corbin. He was hot, sexy, sweet, and romantic. The perfect freaking man right there. He stole my breath more then once with what he would say and how to he acted. He did have me a little mad at some points with the phone calls but I get it now.\n\nAs for Paisley. She is a sweet woman. I have to say that what her dad did sucked butt but for me she made it bigger then what it should of really been. Now maybe I just didn't have the relationship with my dad that she did and I can't see her point of view on it but for me she just blew it out of proportion. That was honestly the only thing that bugged me about this book.\n\nTanner was a hottie and sweetheart but I really started to dislike him at the end. He just started to rub me the wrong way. You DO NOT try to have sex with a girl after her heart has been broken. That is just low in my book.\n\nSo tag chaser.... From what I have read and how this story went. Paisley wasn't a tag chaser. She just preferred to date military guys. She wasn't sleeping with all of them or trying to tie them down and marry them. So to me she is not a tag chaser. But this book was well written and everything played out nicely. Not to fast and no dull moments. I enjoyed it and didn't put it down till I was done.  The ending almost had me crying and I was so glad everything worked out the way it did. Emotion felt real during this book. Especially at the end. I will definitely recommend this book.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It's broken down into lessons that are finely detailed and steps the reader through all the fundamental aspects of notating music with the application.\n\nFor an absolute beginner with Sibelius 7, this is a ten star book. If you go through all the lessons, an investment of approximately ten to twelve hours, you will be using the application confidently and fluidly. There is even an appendix that explores the basics of music theory, although only superficially, and the book in no way is a course in how to compose music, just how to notate music using the software.\n\nIf you are an experienced user, the book may or may not be of use to you. The basic lessons in the various ways to input notes, create, layout and edit scores may be good refreshers but are just likely to be tedious and superfluous. This book also does not touch on how to create the type of complex or non-standard notation that are a common staple of so much post-WWII classical music: in other words, if you want to figure out how to make your scores look like those of George Crumb or Luciano Berio, it would probably be better to turn to the Sibelius 7 reference manual. Also, this is not in itself a reference, even for a beginner, and is not organized for easily looking up how to do things via the index.

In this day and age, we depend on our cellular devices for so many conveniences, Including but not limited to: GPS/Maps, Communication, Information, and so much more! By being so dependent on our cell phones, we quickly drain our batteries, rendering our devices temporarily useless, and potentially putting ourselves into harms way. This is where the Apollo bank by Poweradd comes into play. This device quickly charged both my Samsung Galaxy S5 and iPhone 6s Plus in a device test, just as quickly as having the device plugged into a wall outlet. Any device that is powered by a USB charger can be used on this device. This device features 5000 mAh charging power, a backup solar panel for sunlight charging, a micro USB cable to charge the device, a carabiner to clip the device to your bag, and even a small LED light that can prove to be invaluable in emergency situations! This Charger includes 4 blue LED lights indicating how much power the device currently has. 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%, 3 = 75%, and 4 = 100%. To turn on the LED flashlight for this device, simply hold down the red button above the Poweradd logo to turn it on, and again to turn it off.  It is just about the size of a Samsung Galaxy S5 for reference.\n\nIMPORTANT: if you are sitting here thinking you'll only charge your devices using solar power from now on, this isn't exactly ideal. While this CAN be done, it would take a very long time to charge this device solely using solar power, close to a few days. The solar power feature is intended for situations where you do not have access to electricity, such as when camping, backpacking, traveling, or even during weather emergencies. This is especially useful in New England Winter's when the power is frequently out for days due to severe snow storms. Overall, I think EVERYONE should own a solar powered cell phone charger in case of emergencies, and the Poweradd Apollo is one I would HIGHLY recommend!\n\nI received this product to test in exchange for an honest review.

It lasted well over 15 hours of being turned on, suggesting that you will rarely have to charge this device.\n\nThe solar panel is kind of a gimmick. Does it work? Yes. However, don't expect to leave this device out in the sun for 20 minutes and be given a fully charged device. This device will take at least 24 hours of direct sunlight to function on solar power. This is more of a last resort or emergency feature. Think end of the world or out backpacking in the woods without electricity situations.\n\nThe lantern comes with a hook attached to it so you can easily hang the lantern up if necessary which is a good feature.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful lantern. The battery life is outstanding, and I really enjoy that you can power the device three ways; battery, rechargeable DC battery, and solar power. While the solar power is a cool feature, the panel is small, so it takes a very long time to charge. Use this feature only as a last resort.\n\nI received this product to test in exchange for an honest review.

I seriously devoured it in just hours and shunned all other activities until I was done. The characters come from totally different worlds but they both have drive and determination. This is a story about second chances and taking what you're dealt and making something from it.\n\nCole and Summer come from two different worlds. Cole has killer good looks, is an heir and businessman, a first time producer, and movie star. Hes jaded from his gold digger of a soon-to-be ex-wife which is threatening the timing of this project. Summer is from Quincy, Georgia (where the filming is taking place and shes helping with local logistics), has been an outcast all her life, and her good looks and feistiness tend to get her in trouble. It bounces back and forth between the two towns while they prepare for production and we get to see what has made these two the way they are. Once they actually meet in person theres an instant attraction and sexual tension spikes. I loved their banter and those two sure know how to needle each other. They were both fantastic characters (flaws and all) and I loved getting inside their heads.\n\nDespite the gradual build, this book still does a great job of keeping the reader engaged. Its a great feel good book that has that little extra to spice it up. The hilarious dialogue just adds that levity in what could otherwise be a more serious story. Told in dual POVs, its an excellent chance to see what has happened in their pasts to make them who they are. It was great to be able to follow along in their journey of growing, learning, and loving. Alessandra Torre does an excellent job with describing a situation so you really feel like you're in the story with the characters or watching on a movie screen.

It is not a pleasant memory, and I hadn't noticed the one spot in the description where it mentions this having a hook and eye crotch closure. But I tried it on anyway, with undergarments (top and bottom), and is how I'll wear it - for maximum comfort and effectiveness/cleanliness (I'm the 'weirdo' who wears underwear with pantyhose too, fwiw).\n\nI normally wear a 12/XL, but followed advice/packaging and bought a L - it fight perfect. It was tight, but not soul sucking, OMG I CANT BREATHE tight, just a reassuring \"you're sucked and tucked and look fabulous\" squeeze, like the hug of a trusted friend. It was a bit harder to get into than the brief bottom version, but not bad. Taking it off.... I will admit I may have said a bit loudly as I tried to get it off \"Boyfriend!!! Help!!! I'm stuck!!!\" For some reason I think I had the crotch un-buttoned and was trying to get it off over my head - I have the distinct memory of if all bunch up under my boobs and feeling a bit trapped. This may not be an accurate memory, and I'm definitely going to advocate the putting on and taking off like a swimsuit method for this.\n\nTo test the effectiveness of this, I put on a dress I love that shows the dreaded \"belly button shadow\" - and it smoothed out all the lines and made a much nicer shape. I asked my boyfriend his thoughts, and had him compare the dress with and without the shapewear - he said it was subtle difference, but he did notice one. I'm not crazy, I don't think this will shave 50 or even 25 lbs off my body, but I appreciate the smoothing effective it (and any shapewear) gives, and my boyfriend did think the dress looked better with this. The bottom of the shapewear did stay in place, even when I moved/jumped around in an exaggerated fashion as the ultimate test.\n\nI wasn't sure how comfortable this would be over my own bra - it was, and I decided to buy several other styles. It's a great purchase, because even if it's a small difference, there are some dresses (right or wrong) that I feel self conscious in that this will let me without stupid insecurities at the forefront of my mind.

They will discover that their world, Elan, has a deadly secret history and that many key people are not who they are thought to be. Percepliquis is the grand conclusion of the RIYRIA REVELATIONS.\n\nWhat started out as a straightforward fantasy adventure in The Crown Conspiracy has evolved into a full-blown epic in Percepliquis. Mr. Sullivan accomplished this so discreetly that I didn't even realize how complex the story had become until I cracked open this book. The exciting escapades of two partners in crime have grown to be a world-encompassing high fantasy conflict, complete with many characters who have their own backstories and subplots. That's not to say the sheer fun of it has been sacrificed.\n\nMichael J. Sullivan writes for an adult audience while infusing his novels with all the charm of the favorite stories of our youth. This quality made the RIYRIA REVELATIONS stand out among its contemporaries. All the genre's mainstays are here -- elves, dwarves, goblins, religions and mythologies, medieval settings, kings, princesses, warriors and wizards, magic, and dragons -- but Sullivan uses them all in his own unique way.\n\nRoyce and Hadrian started out as a typical \"brains-and-brawn\" duo comparable to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. That's in no way a bad thing, but it enriched the series to see them develop into their own original characters.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the heroic actions of the Riyria, the noble deeds by many other characters were so endearing that I found myself just as interested in their stories. I don't want to even remotely risk a spoiler, but I will say that this series ending tugged at my jaded heart. That is no small accomplishment, because my usual reading preference is dark-n-gritty tales.\n\nThere are some small details throughout the series that might have been done just a little better. Of these, the dialog is most noticeable, at least to this reviewer. At times, the conversations just didn't quite seem to fit in the traditional fantasy setting. However, this is easily overlooked, especially when these books are viewed as a whole, completed work.\n\nThe RIYRIA REVELATIONS doesn't suffer from the \"middle books syndrome\" that too many series do. Not only does Sullivan maintain the level of interest that he set in The Crown Conspiracy, but the story consistently gets better with each book, making Percepliquis everything that the end of an epic should be and more.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

With no idea where to find him, Royce and Hadrian disguise themselves as sailors in order to board the Emerald Storm, which is the ship believed to be delivering a message to Merrick.\n\nMr. Sullivan has stepped up the action even more for his 4th book about Royce and Hadrian, the professional thieves known as the Riyria. As they sail the Emerald Storm, unknown enemies conspire against them. Raiders hound the ship's wake and their destination is the jungle islands just past the edge of civilized world, where warrior tribes and outlaw bands plot to ally themselves with the Imperialists. And, their goal now just within their grasp, Thrace, Princesses Arista and Amilia intensify their scheme to free the rebel leader Degan Gaunt.\n\nSo far, The Emerald Storm is my favorite book of the series. There are a few elements reminiscent of classic adventure literature, a who-done-it mystery, a pirate tale, and a thriller-type plot twist or two. I particularly enjoyed the warrior-tribe culture of the land of Calis.\n\nAs with all these books, parts might be just a little over-the-top, and there are few things, like the system of magic, that veteran fantasy-readers may find too simplistic, but that's the kind of story this series is. Mr. Sullivan is focusing on just having fun. The theme is in tune with the likes of The Three Musketeers or Pirates of the Caribbean. It's a series that could be considered more or less kid-friendly, but definitely not categorized as YA. When thought of in those terms, RIYRIA REVELATIONS is on its own out there in the fantasy genre, or, at least, the only story like it that stands out.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.61}, {"id": "21395", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nLet me first say this is an awesome idea especially for someone like me who has been around since the Sinclair Spectrum and had significant computers like the Commodore Amiga plus also probably owned just about every console ever made.  Sadly PC games need support nowadays, it is market under siege from the PS4, XBox One and Wii U.  This is because people love the flexibility of consoles.\n\nSo here we are and Alienware has made a bold market move - a PC console but also a full Windows 8 computer (if you add a mouse and keyboard).  First thing - installation - uh don't get me wrong, I have been around the block with install this and that so I am no slouch but this presented me with an issue which I still don't get.  Yes it hooked up fine, only power and HDMI so easy enough and even setting up wireless internet was fine.  Also setting up the Xbox controller was simple enough but note that the pairing button on the controller is the tiny button on the front left, so look at your instructions.\n\nNow once everything started, again I was fine and all went well including saying I had an internet connection but then it decided there was an update.  This is where things went wrong, it said the update server was offline.  I didn't believe this, no way are Alienware not going to have the server working correctly.  Anyway I messed around forever and even accessed the Windows desktop ( hold alt-ctrl-del keys) and updated Windows but with the console mode the same thing kept happening.  Finally I connected a LAN and it worked.  I don't get why the wireless didn't work but eventually everything installed and set up OK.\n\nOnce it loaded up then it is very simple to use and very much like most modern day application type menus.  So load Steam, pick the game you want and download - simple and straightforward or just play ones you already have installed.  I would say the preference is controller games but it isn't a problem to play any game if you have a mouse and keyboard connected.  I downloaded one of my old classics called X-Com UFO Defense and it works perfectly and this is crazy on my Panasonic Plasma TV! It is one of those games that shouldn't be allowed to be played like this but fantastic that you can.  I have more modern games like Metro Last Light and this looks staggering and plays exceptionally well with the Xbox controller.  One thing I did notice is with some games, a reset is needed before you start another game so bear this in mind.  I am not sure this is an issue that can be sorted, I would imagine switching from one game to another is going to overuse the resources so I would get use to the idea that you might have to do this.\n\nAs far the the computer side of this, you get a fully functional Windows 8 computer so everything you can do with a normal computer.  So if you want to download Eve Online because you already have an account then yes you can do this and play it normally.\n\nNow to the actual Hardware itself, this comes in various packages so you can chose to what level you want this as far as CPU etc.  For classic games this package is more than good enough and also for modern games and I would certainly recommend going for the highest spec if you really love your PC games and Steam.\n\nBuild quality looks to be excellent, they put a lot into a console size PC but it works well and doesn't overheat like your PS3 does.  It always looks awesome, bold block with blue neon lights (yes mine is blue and not red)  and that wonderful Alienware logo :)  The controller is XBox and for me it is the best one on the market so I am good on that.\n\nWill this catch on?  I think it is a brilliant idea and if the quality of games can meet the quality of the console then I can see this in most households because you have the chance to play classics and also modern games and the PC catalog is HUGE.  I give it the big thumbs up, for a PC retro-maniac like me who also loves modern games like Fallout etc this is something I have been waiting to have since my Amiga days.  Only sad part is, it will kill the walk in a store and buy a boxed PC game but Gamestop etc pretty much sanctioned the end of this quite a while ago so it is something we have to accept.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I found the historical sections interesting - they were short, clear and to the point. But even though the author is reticent to the point of gentlemanliness about the details of the almost complete destruction of his life and family that came from his being unlucky enough to love a wife whose meth addiction came to blot out everything else in her life. However, the downward trajectory is clear, and we are able to fill in the blanks ourselves.\n\nWhat I respected about this book is that the author didn't depend on sensationalism or lurid details, because, really, he doesn't need to. And it is precisely that kind of not-quite-but-almost objectivity which makes this account so chilling, and so real. The sense is that of hearing a witness account of seeing his house fit by a category F4 tornado. It's horrible, and it could happen to anyone.\n\nWhen I finished the book I felt a terrible sense of loss. I would recommend this book. If you're unfamiliar with the subject of meth (not that I am; I'm not), it seems like a good place to start.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The characters in all 4 books are friends/related to each other. It is more fitting if you know each character before reading the next book. If you read it in this order, I think it will bring more excitement as some questions are answered on the later book. Some secrets are also revealed beforehence.\nThe heroine, Sara, is not a whiner in my opinion.  When she was but a little girl, she  was described as awkward and clumsy, who fortunately, (or unfortunately, depending on the reader) has only outgrown that flaw just a little bit. However, in my opinion, her clumsiness are humorous and somewhat sweet. That made me enjoy this book even more. It is the spice of this book.  Since, she was married to Nathan as a child, growing up, she have already condition herself as a WIFE.  Even when she hasn't seen him for over 10 years, and even after her family insist on her that Nathan is an enemy, somehow, deep inside of her heart, She longed for love and acceptance from her long lost husband, especially since she didn't get such at home.  She kept waiting for him to finally come and collect her.  The collection part was also hilarious.  That's when the fun began...\nThe hero, Nathan, is so manly.  Too manly that he doesn't even know a single terms of endearment to call his wife.  He's never been in a serious relationship, therefore, know nothing above loving a woman.  The learning begins with both of them.  He decided he can control the situation, being married to Sara shouldn't be all that hard, afterall, he's always been a controlled, discipline man.  Or so he thought...\nThe patience of learning about one other...  The adjustment of each other's character, routine and lives... the acceptance and finally, the love...all made this book compelling.  Sara's determination to be accepted not only by her husband but by his staff on board was the funniest moments of all.  She means well, plans well.... but......  Aw~!  It does embarrass me reading about her parasols and her accidents.  I had to stop my reading, close my eyes and cover my face every incident.  After I gather myself together & get over my embarassment, i continue reading, praying she doesn't get into another \"INCIDENT\" again.

I have read more than 10 of her books yet each time, it's a new different adventure.  Yes, I agree that she sometimes described her herione pretty much with the same physical descriptions such as freckles in noses, smells like roses, etc...  However, I find this flaw rather inciting.\nMadelyne's strength, courage, patience and love for others simply captivated me to read on.  Despite all the miserable times she had encountered during her growing up years, she still manages to keep her heart & spirit intact.  Even after all the beatings and living life without a mother and a father, she still counted and appreciated her one single blessing of having an uncle who loved her.  She doesn't dwell on the past, doesn't hold onto hate... and what's even more amazing is her unselfish side of wanting to help others find peace and happiness.  Duncan is a true warrior in every way.  He's honorable & patient. Practical & very disciplined...until love sinked in, and that's when practicality & disciplined became somewhat a burden.\nThe slow realization and acceptance of love between the two was simply perfect.  Each scenes, little gestures of passions made this book irrisistible.  There are many heart warming and humorous scenes in this book as well... The warming of Duncan's feet, the wedding, the learning of archery, the finding of the WOLF, the beginning of friendship with Duncan's sister, Adela & a whole lot more.  I could go on and on but I don't want to give it all away here for those who haven't read it yet. Oh, I must add that I find Madelyne's clumsiness entertaining. The secondary characters all contributed to make this book worth reading for as well.  Perhaps J.G. will write a sequel or a seperate book for Duncan's brothers and Adela's love story?  The family twist and complications added spice and thrill from front to end.

We have a large commercial kitchen in our facilities here, and many, many cooks who eat through these type of thermometers as fast as they eat food. The thermometers we had perviously were the round dial type that stuck into the food and often stayed in the food for long stretches while in the oven. These things got dirty, fouled and stopped working really fast. Too many cooks in the kitchen, I suppose. But THIS thermometer...well, it takes the work out of everything. First off, it is really hygenic because the temp stick can be cleaned and submerged and sanitized without damaging the actual measuring part since they both come apart and the actual measuring device remains far from the food. Click the thing on and easy pick the icon of what meat you are cooking: the icons are a cow, a chicken and so on. The Thermopro TP-04 then asks what temp you want after first suggesting the proper temp per health guidelines. If you want more time, button up, less time, button down. The TP-04 gives you additional choices of well done, rare, and medium if you don't already know what those temps are supposed to be. I tell ya...this thing makes sure no matter who the user or what skills they have that the cooking will be done to the correct number each and every time with little hassle, no need to continue to open the oven door. The long temp probe can be closed in the oven door and allow the unit to work contnuously so you know exactly where the food is in the total cooking process. I have had young workers use this first time flawlessly. Really, pick this thing up and make cooking easier.

It was bulky to store, though and a bit of a bear to clean. Enter the new version: it not only looks great in designer colors and a compact, round style, but lo and behold it works better than the original. Every piece comes out for cleaning in the dishwasher within a minute or less, so the over always stays clean as new with no effort. The oven fold down so compactly when not in use, that it fits in a pantry shelf, ready to got in a moments notice. Nothing, and I mean nothing cooks chicken like this oven. Without extra injections of marinades, chicken comes out moist and falling off the bone within 45 minutes or less, even for a large bird. In the oven, it would lake at least and hour, and even then with some pink spots. This is foolproof. I'm really excited to work a turkey next. Once a wekk we rotiss a whole chicken and get a meal out of that, and then save the rest to make broth for soup later in the week. Nothing is healthier than this as the meat never sits in grease which you then consume. It fall to the bottom tray after self basting and washes up without even needing to touch it in the dishwasher. You will not regret this purchase. In fact, I would consider it a perfect wedding gift. Every your couple would benefit from fast, top nothc meals.

It seems that most everyone in that region wanted to rule Ireland except maybe the Irish who were too busy clan fighting to resist the English under King John or the upstart Scottish King Robert the Bruce.  It is in this chaotic period that we meet our protagonist Syr Richard Savage, formerly of Ulster but who joined The Knights Templar as a personal quest to find meaning in life.  Unfortunately for Savage, the Templars are declared heretics and are condemned by The Pope so after being betrayed by a former Templar now turned Knight Hospitaller, he has been incarcerated for 5 years awaiting his fate.  Fortunately for Savage, King John(the son of Longshanks) has a pressing need for a former Ulsterman to spy out what is happening in Ireland regarding the Scots and the rumors of invasion.\n\nThe author has given us a tale with an intriguing cast of characters from the effeminate King John, the duplicitous Templar turned Hospitaller, The Bruce brothers Robert and Edward, a host of Scots, Irish, and Norman descendants, loyal mercenaries and witchcraft accused mother and daughter.  The story runs the gamut of human emotions, love, hatred, loyalty, loss and redemption, to name a few.  It also has The Grail and how it came to be in possession of Robert the Bruce and how he uses it to gain allies.  Given the many Grail stories and tales that are out there I found that the author gives a credible rendition though perhaps not as good a one as in the Monty Python movie.  :-)\n\nAll in all, Lions of the Grail is a fast paced, intriguing story full of twists and turns, full of villainous treachery, full of valor and courage.

However, they have a problem in Ulster as Castle Carrickfergus is somehow surviving a siege and a famine.\n\nI was riveted to the pages as the author has produced a book at full throttle.

Almost on a whim, at the prompting of aircraft designer Bert Rutan (Dick's brother), they start the project: to fly around the world without refueling. They start building the aircraft on a shoestring, on $100 donations and with Burt's and his company's help. They fight with each other. Dick fights with Burt. Somehow, they build the plane, test it, work through the many problems of a hand-made, one-off design. Dick comes to hate and fear the aircraft -- a barely-flyable, grossly-uncomfortable machine. They suffer through 4 1/2 days of flying 12,000 miles nonstop, in loops off the California coast.\n\nOn the strength of this record-breaking flight, they get more support, fix the problems, take off around the world in late 1986. Weather and airplane fight them the whole way. They fix the mechanicals as best they can and forge on, nonstop for just over 9 days and 26,366 miles aloft. They make a triumphant return to Edwards AFB just before Christmas, 1986.\n\nThen they go on the road to raise the $400,000 or so they needed to pay off their debts. And write this book. Which I can't recommend too highly. Amazing aircraft, and story.\n\nHappy reading--\nPeter D.

Moving on, this time we are taken to The Point Resort, were we meet Kelsey. Trying to start over, she is a devoted mother and worker. I loved her character and felt like she really stole the show, well as much as she could when her son wasn't trying to steel my heart. No, he totally stole it.\n\nOliver was alright, he had his good points but, other then being sweet and hot, there wasn't anything real special about him. I know this is a romance and as a couple Kelsey and Oliver had mad connections, I just feel like if Oliver wasn't in the picture, then the story would've still moved on, and still would've been great. Don't get me wrong Oliver as a whole was a well rounded character. He just didn't add that much, for me, to the story. Like say, he was a woman, overall outside of the smut, the story would have played out the same. Now I would like to point out that I did love them as a couple, and loved their interaction and growth. I just wish Oliver wasn't, so, boring. Again this is my personal opinion, so don't take it too much to heart.\n\nOver all I did very much enjoyed this story. Like the other books in this series (I read all these out of order) the writing is outstanding, the plot is steady and has a clear goal. The tone had that light, funness to it, that kept you smiling and engaged. I had a hard time putting this book down.

The corks always come out with very little effort and never broken. This little set is a great for either a gift or a starter set for anyone who drinks wine at home. It comes with a foil cutter, which is much easier to use than the sharp end of a knife. There are 4 circular blades that clip against the bottle, so all you need to do is squeeze and turn. You will get a perfectly cut foil. Once the foil is removed you can snare the cork. Simply place the rabbit over the top of the bottle and lift the top handle up. You will squeeze the other silver handle and black part of the opener in your opposite hand to hold it onto the bottle. Then just press the lever down - the corkscrew will go into the cork - and then pull the lever back up - the cork will be removed from the bottle. To release the cork just do the exact same action without being attached to the bottle - the cork will fall off the screw as you pull the lever back up. From there yu can use one of the two re-cappers to cap off the bottle until you are ready to pour again. They even give you an extra screw in case you should ever need a replacement in the future. The set comes beautifully boxed so if you choose to give this as a gift, it will look and feel as elegant as it is.

However, it did not take long for me to become completely spoiled with the ease of use and speed of this opener. The opener will come with 4 rechargeable batteries (at least mine did even though the description says they are not included), which fit into the top of the unit. Just take the end cap off and look closely at the area where the batteries go and you will see the + and - signs for how to place the batteries before replacing the end cap. While I could use my opener right out of the box, it is recommended that you first charge the unit with the charging cord, that also comes with the wine opener. Simply plug the male end into the opener and plug into the wall. The red indicator light will let you know that the batteries are charging. To use this could not be more simple. There are two soft rubber buttons, one turn the corkscrew clockwise, the other counterclockwise. The advantage here is that once you place the opener over the bottle, hold down the button and remove the cork, you can then reverse the direction to discharge the cork into your hand. There is no twisting, pulling or clever wrist action needed to use this. If you can press a button, you can open a bottle of wine, which will be wonderful for anyone with painful hands or hands with limited movement abilities. You will also receive a replacement screw in case you should ever need it. To date, we've had no broken corks and the unit has never jammed. I also like that the screw is always completely enclosed in the plexiglass surrounding it so that nothing can get tangled in it during use. It also helps protect the sharp tip. My guess is that after you try this wine opener, the rest of the ones you own will all sit in a drawer.

That is what the students of suburban Milwaukee high school must find out in The Woods.\n\nThere are a few different groups that form in the aftermath of the sudden move. One goes out to explore the world around them, while the others try to create a semblance of order within the school building. This split drives the plot of the book, with the story jumping back and forth between these two sides.\n\nSome of what happens implies that there is a deeper story about why this school was chosen, if indeed it was. The character personalities felt distinguishable from one another, though they were somewhat shallow at times. The book is a little shorter than most and could have used the extra space to develop these out a bit more. For what is in the book, I think the characters are done well. I look forward to seeing what happens with them.\n\nOne thing that kind of bugged me is how quickly things turn sour. It is literally within a day that a tyrannical regime tries to take control of the school. Again, space may have helped here. A slower development to that, even over the course of a couple days, would have seemed more believable. The characters seem to ignore some of the things that happen on an emotional level. I could see the alien environment having an effect on them, but it should be stated more clearly.\n\nI feel like I am bashing on the book a bit, but it is quite good. It sucked me in quickly and had me rooting for certain characters. And the art is great. The strange landscapes and creatures have just enough basis on things from our own world to give the reader a reference point. From there, the creators have some fun letting their imaginations go wild on what might populate this world.\n\nThe book may appeal more to high school age students because they would more easily identify with the characters. However, it should appeal to a wider audience.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Joyride is a seriously fun, action packed space adventure. Earth made contact with alien races and is now ruled by a dictatorship that restricts anyone from leaving the planet. With this premise, the book could have gone really dark and turned into a dystopian story. Instead, everything about it is bright and energetic. There are conflicts to keep things interesting though.\n\nI love the characters. From the rebellious Uma to the hitchhiker Kolstak. Every one of them adds personality to the book. There is enough variety to keep me engaged and prevent things from becoming flat. The development of the characters individually and as a whole over the course of the story is great too. Despite some differences, it sort of makes sense that they would keep travelling together.\n\nBut the stand out portion of this book is the art. I really like the style for the characters. Most of them are little more than kids and the art captures that. Their expressions are detailed and support the text. The colors do a lot to create the tone of the book. I think the panel work is awesome too. They do a lot to draw the eye down the page, so even if they are used in an unusual way I didn't feel confused as to where I should be looking or reading next. Then there are the scenes that juxtapose two characters. These go a long way to show how the characters are similar and different without spelling things out.

This has not influenced my review.*\n\nThe book was very gritty, grungy, and dirty (literally dirty, like with dirt and sweat and other bodily fluids). The main character lived in the slums. The book was filled with drug addiction and lots of mentions of prostitution and rape (though no explicit sceneswell, except one scene in which Andi and some others were touched without consent). There were graphic descriptions of various sorts of disgusting things, including injuries and dead bodies. Every other word in Andis head or out of her mouth was some sort of guttermouth slang. So basically, it is not a book for the easily offended or weak-stomached.\n\nSpeaking of Andis voice though, it was very different from the usual that you find in books, which was refreshing. It was full of slang and completely colored by her life and situation. I cant really explain it, but I recommend reading a preview of the book on Amazon (or somewhere) to get a feel for it if you're unsure about whether youll like it or not. (Reading a preview will also show you how gritty the book is.)\n\nThere was also a great message in this book not just about being intersex but about being who you are and letting people be who they are. The main characters didn't want to be assigned a binary gender, they were happy just being themselves with the bodies they were given, and all they wanted was to be given the option to keep those bodies.\n\nThe plot/pacing was where I think the book lost me though. I didn't understand/believe/see the point of some things (for example, I felt like there was no way Andi wouldnt have died of infection after everything her body went through), and I just wasn't gripped. Also, the timeline for how their society came to be the way it was didn't make sense, unless I just misunderstood (which is possible because I was confused). And to be honest, I think the language and Andis voice got to be a little bit too much for me after a while.\n\nHowever, overall, it had a somewhat unique premise, it included representation of a part of the LGBTQIA+ community that you don't see often in books, and the writing had a deep POV with a unique voice.\n\nRating: 3 Stars\n\nOriginal Review @ Metaphors and Moonlight (link in profile)\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

A small, stocky people well suited for riding, they rapidly came to dominate the central and southern plains of North America, placing them directly in the path of the expanding American Republic as it moved westward via new settler migration and war with Mexico over the western territories held by that country.\n\nGwynne intersperses his tale of the rise of the Comanche and their fierce war with other Indian tribal nations (including Apaches and Tonkawas, both of whom would develop an undying hatred of their foes and align themselves with the incoming whites to eventually bring the Comanche down) with an account of the background, birth and rise of Quanah Parker, the half white war chief of the Comanche nation who would lead them in their final struggle with white civilization. In the interim, the Republic of Texas broke away from Mexico to become the Comanche's most dangerous enemy. But not at first.\n\nInitially, the early Texans were outclassed because they were used to the forests and mountains of their eastern homes. Armed only with the slow-to-reload muzzle loading rifles of the era (which required plenty of cover between shots and could not be easily reloaded on horseback), they could neither outshoot nor outride the wild Comanche warriors in a country where cover was scarce and often non-existent. It took a series of disastrous defeats before the Texans slowly got it together and learned to fight with the relentless ferocity of the Comanche from horseback, mastering the trails and redoubts of the country itself in the process. Nor did it hurt when the advent of the revolver in the mid 1840's gave the newly formed, and still green, Texas Rangers a marked advantage over the mounted Comanche warrior equipped only with bow and arrow.\n\nThe book recounts the gradual erosion of Comanche dominance as it gives the history of Quanah's mother, Cynthia Ann Parker, captured as a nine year old girl and adopted by members of the Comanche band that took her. Eventually married to a Comanche warrior, she is finally retrieved by whites only to pine away until her early death because of her lost husband and sons. Quanah, her eldest, is left to fend for himself at the age of twelve and eventually grows into a large and powerful warrior in his own right, the man who will lead the last free band of Comanches until he is finally run to ground and beaten by the U.S. Army -- having at last learned to fight Indians the Indian way.\n\nThis is a fine book that deals with an important part of Texas history as well as the history of America's western plains overall. Importantly, it offers a comprehensive and vivid picture of the Comanche nation from its first appearance as a competitor for the resources of the Great Plains until its final defeat in the late 1800's. A very valuable addition to any library of the west.\n\nStuart W.

Or at least, getting more creative WITH their guitars and finally balancing them with their vocals.\nNorthern Star, to the metal veteran might just seem like your typical fare of Viking-themed music with really great vocal work. The lead vocalist in this band, if you haven't heard him yet, is one of the best vocalists in all of metal if you ask me. Not necessarily because he can hit great highs and lows (hence he's not a classically trained singer, because he actually never attempts to hit epic highs or gutteral lows and doesn't seem to have the ability to anyway), but because he's been gifted with a naturally powerful and melodic vocal tone, which translates well into singing for a metal band... although to be honest, he would fail at singing for any other genre of music, but might make a good career of doing voice-overs for books and such. Listen to some clips to see what I'm talking about. Anyway, the metal veteran with taste in melodic metal bands will see and hear the originality in a Viking metal band that decided they will not use harsh growling or death/screeching vocals. This is NOT Viking black metal, this is NOT Viking death metal, not even close; this is epic pulse-pounding Viking metal. This band doesn't mess with those other sub-genres because it wouldn't fit with the mountainous, cloudy skies and epic journeying atmosphere this band wants to create. This music isn't dark music at all, nor is it angry, it's actually very leaned towards heroism, bravery, victory and celebration.\n\nWhat disappointed me about Tyr in previous albums is the, to put it bluntly, sheer BOREDOM I found in their songs; simply mediocre and lazy songwriting. All they seemed concerned about was their vocalist - he sounded great, so any sort of creativity with guitar work and atmosphere was put to the back seat. Sections dragged on, riffs were plain and flat, solos were just filler, choruses were unimaginative, lyrics were unintelligible, contrived and overly historical and metaphorical... I seriously have no idea why they still remained as popular as they did. Just name me ONE memorable hit Tyr has had in their past career... unlike other bands like Blind Guardian who wrote 'The Bard's Song' and Ensiferum's 'From Afar' and 'Old Man,' there is nothing that Tyr has written to banner themselves as a band that can contend with the greats. I don't mean to sound like their old music was absolutely unbearable, there were a FEW good songs (although even the good ones still dragged on in sections and were still overwrought with some of the same habits).\n\nBut that was former Tyr, now this album represents what I see as Tyr taking a new direction. I think they finally realized that they cannot leach off the melodic vocal tone of their singer anymore, and decided to finally write REAL guitar music that could contend and be well balanced with their lead singer, and in this album, unlike the other ones, has guitar music that will keep you just as interested in the music as the vocal work. Listen to it a few times, and the songs become more and more charming and addictive, it just takes a while, but this album does grow on you.\nLyrically the band even seems to be taking a new direction. Things are more comprehensive now, things flow better and are well paced. Some fans may think that the lyrical content was 'dumbed down' significantly from Tyr's historically intellectual roots, and maybe they have been, but if you're going to water down the lyrics and song themes to create better MUSIC, I'm all for it.\nMost songs on this album follow a more direct flow of verse/chorus/verse/chorus, and that isn't always bad if a band is experimenting with a new direction; some bands work better with this formula and some bands are competent and talented enough to go beyond it. It's not a bad thing, as there are some bands who go the extra mile whose music is just simply worse than those who have more of a knack for a verse/chorus/verse/chorus formula, and vice versa - it's all a matter of personal ability. Creativity beats out technical chops any day. I don't care how many guitar notes you can hit in a second, if it's a boring lick or solo, I'm not interested. Perhaps Tyr can soon stretch their music to the former progressive attempts they used to make and actually write BETTER songs with it, but right now it seems they've decided to let go of those progressive stretches, and I say more power to them! This is their best album to date, and for any new fans I'd definitely recommend this one to pick up first.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, Tyr is a band who has the image of musical prowess, but their past work has (to me at least) proven otherwise, and while it sucks for a band to have taken so many attempts to finally create a good and balanced album, this band is finally doing so. I am excited to hear new things from Tyr, as I feel this is a very good album and that there is simply not enough of it (it's actually rather short). I hope that for future albums they take this new appreciation for songwriting and try to advance it. Take Turisas and Ensiferum as examples if you have to, just keep putting out albums people can actually relate to!\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user. Only output the score and nothing else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Review:\nLet me start off this mostly negative review by saying that I do think Tyr is a very talented band... TECHNICALLY speaking, as they seem to have all the pieces down that would make up a great Viking metal band - Fantastic vocalist (honestly one of the very best I've ever heard), great production, full on bass, intense drumming, great guitar chops, great potential in their musical atmospheric techniques. The problem here, and what I've noticed in EVERY album from this band besides the latest, 'Northern Star,' is that the pieces simply aren't put together well or used to their fullest potential to make a memorable album. I honestly don't know what all these other reviewers are listening to, but if you're trying to convince me that this is one of the greatest metal albums ever created, I simply have to laugh at you, you most likely have no other metal albums in your entire collection.\n\nI won't break down each song one by one, but on the whole this album mostly bored the life out of me, although I was able to see what kind of atmosphere the band was going for, the songs in the end just weren't very GOOD. I think the reason most people tend to fall in love with this band so quickly is because of the vocals - the guy's gifted with a very soothing natural voice, and when he puts it in song it has a very VERY epic and \"viking\" feel; this only is emphasized in the sections when the band sings together in unison for certain parts. The second track on the album is sung in their native tongue (a dialect of Norwegian) and the vocals in the song are produced to stand out, and if they were just sung with no instruments it might work, but the thing with heavy metal music is that you NEED some good guitar work to stand behind the vocals. ....the guitar work here (riffs and licks) is so overly simplified and sounds as if they just made it up as they went along, and just wanting everyone to hear their vocals more than anything else, the guitars really just taking a back seat.\n\nThere are 2 songs on this album that I decided to keep on my Ipod, because while they aren't masterpieces, they do have some pretty good choruses (which honestly feels more like luck than anything else). Still, even within these 2 songs the choruses are too few and far between, and mostly surrounded by more substandard guitar work (in the realm of creativity at least); I wish they would've just listened to these songs more and trimmed the fat off of them.\n\nA masterpiece?? I don't think so, not even close. This is one of those albums that gets by on the band's image, cover art, lyrical themes, and bare bones vocal work (if this band had a different vocalist, I seriously think EVERYONE would hate this album)... but when it comes down to actual creative and engrossing songwriting, this album drags lazily and never makes any attempt to pick up the pace. If you're into bands like Ensiferum, Wintersun, Blind Guardian, or other melodic metal or viking metal bands, this album will do nothing for you. If you're curious to get into Tyr, I would strongly suggest only picking up their latest album - By The Light Of the Northern Star, which finally feels like the first album where the band finally decided to take more time into making good guitar-driven songs (it only took them 4 albums to finally get it somewhat right).\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n\n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 3.19}, {"id": "21480", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nYep, it fit perfectly in my 2001 Honda Odyssey.

IT'S on the COVER for goodness sakes!!\n\nComing from a seasoned hardcore gamer, this game has left nothing behind.  Both the single player and muliplayer aspects of this game are nothing short of astounding.\n\nJust when I thought gameplay just couldn't get any better for a FPS, this game came out and just blew everything I knew about FPS out of the water.\nEverything down to the intuitive button configurations and ability to modify button configurations is just fantastic.\n\nThe story line is phenominal and totally realistic. The physics are barnone the best I have ever seen/experienced. The weapons are as real as they come, and the multiplayer environment is fast paced and well thought out.\n\nIntroduction to class creation, weapon customization, ranking and xp points unlocking various weapons, and challenge bonuses just make the replayability of this game endless.  Sure a few of these just mentioned have existed before in other games, however I don't think that they have all been combined and interweaved so beautifully.  Also, when you get to rank 55, you get to make a tough choice.. I won't spoil it for you, you will find out when you get there.\n\nThe graphics are some of the best I have ever seen in a game, and is up there on par with Metal Gear Solid 4, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, and Gran Turismo 5 Prologe.\n\nGoing back to the storyline, in the single player mode seeing the nuke's being launched and a nuke being detonated gave me goose bumps and brought a tear to my eye.  Bringing back memories of what all our forebearers gave their lives so selflessly to protect us from such evil.. just phenominal.\n\nAHH Yes you knew it was coming... the CONS or downsides of the game.\n1. OPEN MICS!! Sounds like a GREAT idea right? Well not so much.  You have people playing that have a fan blowing on them, or aspiring to be a future rap star, or music in the background, or kids crying in the background, or parents yelling at their kids.. well you get the idea.(Just.. should have integrated a button to activate mic channel) To be fair, you can selectively mute people, but you shouldn't have to do so to begin with.\n2. The lack of a server based online environment like Socom 3 has. Which makes it more difficult to locate friends if they are already in a game.\nYes you can invite a freind into the game, or have a \"party\" before launching the auto find game feature.  But a friend saying \"Yea, I'm in US Central 5 Server, Game Name is Yo Momma\" system I think is better suited for online gaming.  Perhaps having both features would be more helpful than just one or the other.\n3. The complete meaninglessness of clan tags, anyone can dupe your clan tag without being invited to the clan.  In Socom, you sent out invites to clans, in this game you just type it in without any control of the clan.\n4. Seperate map pack.. now comon, I just spent 60 bucks on this game and you want to double dip another $10 out of me for 3 more maps?  Get real guys, just include the maps to begin with please. To this day I have not purchased the map pack and don't really wish for more levels to begin with.\n5. The knack of you being able to spot someone 200 yards away with the naked eye and pick them off seems a little unrealistic.  But I think this gets caulked up to HD graphics/HD Tv's to be honest with you.  We for so many years have been squinting at that dern TV saying.. honey come here, is that a guy in the bushes? So that when we can finally SEE what we are doing it just becomes unnatural feeling somehow.\n\nOverall the cons do not outweigh the benefits by a long shot, and do yourself a favor and get this GAME!!  You will have a hard time putting down the controller, I guarantee it!!\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Although, it is geared predominantly toward outlining the soft skills necessary for becoming a successful and influential project manager, these skills are applicable to anyone in any job or in everyday life. I believe anyone can achieve success with these methods.\n\nProject managers operate without any formal authority, so they use informal power by influencing team members and other stakeholders. There are many traits that enable a project manager to gain influence over time such as by being authentic (say what you mean) and acting with integrity (do what you say). Trust is of utmost importance and that has to be earned. Mentoring is another level of influence and so is the act of influencing others who then become a positive influence for someone else (this type of influence has a multiplying effect).\n\nThis book is 179 pages of easy reading written in a conversational style that guides the reader on how to gain the power of influence.  This advice can be applied to other professions as well. For example, in the develop commitment chapter, the author says \"Persuasion encourages someone to do something once.  Influence is about encouraging them to keep on doing something and to keep on supporting you.\" In that chapter he describes how that is done in several ways. The hook is one way to start influencing someone we never met. He goes on to describe three hooks that work for him.  When I was reading his example, it brought to mind the hook I used about 12 years ago when I was trying to raise $1,900 for a 60-mile breast cancer walk.  I thought this was impossible at the time but I made a pact with myself that since this would be the only time I would ever raise a large sum of money I would give it my all.  With this in mind, I decided to contact every acquaintance I knew and some I did not know.  I wrote each one a brief email that established a personal connection with them by reminding them how we knew each other or how I came upon their name. Then I told them my goal and asked for a donation. I figured most people would ignore a bulk email but not an individual one and I was right. In the end, 91 people donated a total of $5,470 to sponsor me which does not include the $550 in donations made by 2 other acquaintances who donated to a different breast cancer organization in my name. In total I was able to raise $6,020. It was the hook I used that allowed me to influence most of the people I wrote including several who I never met and who never met me.  When the walk was done, I sent a handwritten card and a story I wrote about the event to thank each of the 91 sponsors. I even attached a picture of me in those cards I sent to the people who I never met so that they would see who they had supported. The hook got them listening and the thank you helped them remember and established a rapport.  Hooks are used by sales representatives as an influencing tactic and this example can be seen as selling someone on a cause.\n\nOn another note, there are brief scoring exercises at the end of each chapter that I used to rate my influencing skills.  A couple of exercises I found confusing. For example, in the active listening chapter it is unclear to me how I was supposed to use my scores because the author mentions they had to be broken down into five dimensions, yet the questions were not broken down by those dimensions.\n\nI do think this book is way overpriced at the current price of $38.84 even though the advice is excellent. Personally, I would not pay more than $23 for this small text.  Nevertheless, this book will help most people understand and acquire the soft skills necessary for becoming a successful project manager or successful \"anybody.\" I found it to be an incredible read with outstanding and sensible advice.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

In part one of the book, the author describes the nine steps toward achieving favorable change.  These stages include developing a sense of urgency, unifying the team, communicating a clear vision, etc.  Part two of the book focuses in the broad sense on how to lead this change which is mostly about effective communication and good planning.\n\nThere are some gems of wisdom in this text.  For instance, as part of step 8 (which is assessing, recruiting, and empowering the broader team), the author makes it clear why you might hire someone who failed on a project. The reason is that those who failed and learned from their mistakes may offer priceless insight.\n\nIn the communicating and connecting to inspire chapter he makes it clear that it is not about what you say; its about what they hear.  You may think your message inspires and motivates, but if your team has not heard it that way, you have not succeeded.\n\nTwo more quotes that I found inspiring were:\n\n1)  We earn the right to communicate electronically by the time and energy we invest in communicating personally.\n\n2) Electronic communication is a tool for communicating informationnot for inspiring passion.\n\nIn combination with the excellent advice, I would have liked examples with more substance, however.  For instance, he told how Howard Schultz (Starbucks CEO) inspired his staff everywhere by penning a weekly Transformational Agenda that he released on Mondays.  I would have liked a sample agenda in the book that dissected why and how this worked.  In another example, the author himself mentioned that he was questioned by an employee in a town hall meeting about how he and other executives received multi-million dollar bonuses and wanted to know how this equates with the culture of economy and expense control he was espousing.  The author mentioned how he publicly congratulated the employee for asking such a difficult question but never said how he answered it or why his answer worked and was inspiring.\n\nOverall, I feel this is a great book from which current and aspiring managers can gain some insight on how to lead change and inspire others. For me, I would have to read this more than once to make the concepts my own as it is chock full of good advice.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.93}, {"id": "21506", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nCreed is back in their latest installment \"Weathered\", and what a fine weathered friend it is.\nDefinitely stronger then their last effort \"Human Clay\", \"Weathered\" improves with guts, glory, and taking a chance in new arenas.\nThough \"Human Clay\" had some strong cuts like the classic \"With Arms Wide Open\", they comeback stronger than ever with their first single \"My Sacrifice\", a rock, hook dream.\nThe production, arrangement, and quality of this album supercedes their predecessors.\nLead vocals are in the finest of form.

I hate cheating (probably the reason I couldn't give it the full 5 stars) but somehow the author made it work in this book. First, you didn't get to know the wife, in so many books it's a love triangle where you like all the characters and it just becomes frustrating. Second, Matteo was unhappy and truly in love with Vera, he made bad choices but acted in the moment. Third, she felt so much guilt the whole time. I liked both the H/h and I love when that happens in a book. Matteo did piss me off in a certain chapter towards the end of the book and I won't say anything about that because it could be slightly spoilerish but he definitely had me thinking twice about him. Another great thing about this book was Vera's younger brother Josh (which I'm hoping to get a book about). He was so supportive of Vera and her choices.\nJosh: \"I don't think it can be wrong if it comes from a pure place. I suppose you could be like one of those chicks who just keeps it all inside and secretly pine for someone for their whole life until it kills them. But your not. What you feel isn't wrong, Vera...it's not black and white like that.\" Another insightful Josh quote.\nJosh: \"You just fell in love with each other at a very messy time. It's life. It happens. Matteo never set out to fall in love, to hurt his wife...\" I'm not wring the rest of this quote because it could be a spoiler. I really thought the age difference would bother me too, but it didn't.

Isolated, lost and misunderstood.\nI took my time with this one; talk about a slow burn, the buildup to this book is insane. You see this relationship go from banter, friendship, romance, steam, angst, and love. It happens slowly and keeps you turning the pages to find out whats to become of these two unique individuals.\nAs they learn more and more about each other they form an intense bond. Tahoe our hero has relocated to a small town in Florida and all his sights are set on one thing and that one thing didn't include the heroine. It did include her and her fathers airport, but in the process of trying to convince Caroline (heroine) to use it, his heart has other plans. Once Tahoe has committed to something he isn't going to give up, (whether it is the girl or the airport). This is where the slow build to the story happens.\nHeartbreak tells you the love was real. You cant be afraid of the end at the beginning. Go full throttle and see what happens.\nTahoe has had his own heartbreak and has had a hard time moving on from it. Caroline never thought shed find love in her small town and never wanted to give herself to anyone until she starts dating Tahoe.\nYou get this feeling when you want to keep something. Its scary and vulnerable. It makes you feel like your skin is flipped inside out. It changes everything. Keeping that quality, keeping it, has to be protected at all costs. You become obsessed with keeping that which you cant sacrifice.\nThe both start falling hard and it scares them but as I said earlier, Tahoe is committed, but he is also obsessed with perfection.\nHer world is already open. Im excited to show her another piece of it.\nThis is a sweet story of two people that find each other at the right time.\nThis is a favorite quote of mine between the two characters; it is simple but so clever and really made me feel.\nIm falling for you, Caroline May.\nIm flying for you, Tahoe Holiday.\nIm going to lie and say Tahoe didn't piss me off, he definitely screws up and Caroline is a tough girl and held her ground with him, I loved that.\nOne thing I found that I really enjoyed about this book was its not the typical virgin romance and youll understand that once you read it.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.13}, {"id": "21510", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nLoved the stories.  5 romances of will they or won't they.

While the books primary focus is on relationships, the inclusion of Godly principles brought out a great message and worked wonderfully in the plot.  We all struggle from time to time with ourselves and the main theme present in this book is to love yourself first and foremost.  When we learn to look after ourselves, we're a better help and comfort to others.  As a first novel, Ms. Simmons' book has left a lasting impression on me and I see potential for greater works incorporating the same themes.\nClara works as a psychologist at a women's crisis shelter.  She is involved in a relationship with Jason, who loves her dearly and has asked her to marry him.  She has refused, even though she loves him, because she has decided that she never wants to marry or have children.  This understandably causes a rift in their relationship but they struggle to hang on.  The stress of Clara's job and non-addressed issues of her past threaten to destroy Clara as well as her relationship with Jason.  She's taken to drinking to drown painful memories and actions. She feels that her work at the shelter isn't effective, that she's not reaching her clients.  Her mother is an alcoholic and her older sister has coupled booze with drugs to bury the painful sting of her past.  On the outside Clara is listening and providing counsel to people who need to talk about their problems, while on the inside she is need of counsel.  As her world spirals downward she decides to seek help for herself.  Enters Justine, Clara's counselor.  Justine is laid back, casual and very open to discussing things at Clara's pace.  The only requirement is that God be central to any advice given.  The bible is the instruction manual by which the counseling center operates and Justine prays for and with each of her clients.\nThe plot thickens. Clara teeters on the edge of sanity when her mother is hospitalized near death, her sister is out of control, an old flame comes back into her life after Jason removes himself, and her clients are sinking deeper into their problems - her only hope is to turn to the Savior.  Never a religious woman, Clara finds solace in her choice to give her life to Christ and she finds comfort in continued counseling sessions with Justine.  Uncovering her past, and finding that her past is tied to a client of hers that has a split personality, talking about what she's always considered to be Nobody's Business is helping her climb out of the pit of despair that her life is in.  As Clara discovers painful truths about her childhood, she becomes supportive to others.  As she learns more about herself, she is able to share more with others and take her own advice.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

How important bonds are and the nurturing it takes to make successes of these bonds made this Christian Fiction book, more real that the word \"fiction\" implies.  Ma Grand and her daughter Pam had a strained relationship at best.  Ma Grand was from the `old school' so to say, where it wasn't as important to say those three magical words `I love you' as it was to show them.  She had inherited those traits from her parents so saw no need to give that type of attention to her daughter Pam.  When Marley came along, Pam felt differently about that towards her daughter and willingly lavished not only positive words, but also influence and affection upon her. It is this relationship that propels Marley to experience the same in her relationship with Gerrard her fianc.  As the novel begins, we are transported to the engagement party of this socialite couple and while things appear bright from the heavy hitters on the invitation list, looks can be deceiving.  As Marley soon finds out, her fianc has other interests that don't place his relationship with her in the forefront of his decisions and this leads to their eventual demise.  As Marley searches for strength in the midst of this pain, illness strikes home with her mother Pam.\nShrouded in seemingly dark clouds, an invitation to join her secretary in church provides a ray of sunshine to Marley.  As if God is speaking to her with every word that proceeds from the Minister's mouth, Marley has at last found solace - a resting place for her heart and soul.  An added bonus is the introduction of Lazarus into her life a God Fearing Christian, upright man.  Not many of them exist today and what a treasure when one is found.  It is through this relationship, with this Godly man that Marley reconciles in her mind the relationship between Ma Grand and her mother, and the relationship between her mother and herself.  God creates and nurtures bonds on an individual basis because of his omnipresence.  Marley blossoms into a strong Christian woman through the love of a great man and the love of great family.  Through That Faith, That Trust, That Love that Marley has for God, the manifestation is seen throughout her relationships others.  This is a very inspirational read to those of us who want our lives to be used by God for his purpose.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.78}, {"id": "21512", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nPersonally I think this is a great collection of Elton Johns best. For anyone growing up in the late 19060's early 70's this has what I believe to be his best work. After looking at a few of the single CD's in this 5 Classic Album Collection. This collection cost much less and in my opinion it sounds great. There is outstanding articulation in both the words and music. Nothing sounds flat or muffled like so many of the analog to digital transfers do from that area.\n\nThe Collection of Cd's are all in jewel cases carried within a very nice well made heavy duty cardboard box. The box has an outstanding look and feel to it and is designed so that you can see the title of each CD clearly once opened. On the back of the box is a list showing the names of the albums and all of the songs on those albums. The dark blue color of the box and clean white lettering make a great contrast so reading the information is very easy.\n\nThe sound Quality is very good on every CD in the collection. All of the songs display good to outstanding dynamics and clarity. It might have been nice to have seen these titles remastered in the similar box set, but there's nothing really wrong with the audio quality here. It's only my opinion, but so many of the songs on these CD's are such classics that they deserve to be polished listened to at highest possible quality. After saying that I have to say there really is nothing wrong with the sound quality, and the set is a great bargain at the current price of $20.98. It would have just been nice to hear as much detail as humanly possible in these classics.\n\nHonestly I love everything about this set. Personally I feel this collection is rich with some of the best songs ever written. Crossing lines in just about every genre. Many of these songs where played on radio stations specializing in everything from Country to Rock. Each CD is loaded with songs that put Elton John on the top of the charts and kept him there for years. Many if not most of these songs have stood the test of time, and still carrying the emotion and feeling that Elton John was so able to share in his music.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Now I will say I understand if a few mistakes are found along the way. But this far surpasses a few mistakes. By the time I finished the book was filled with little yellow tabbies. Yes, I mark all mistakes in every book I read with tabbies. It wasn't just a few misspelled words, there were those, but it was added words that made sentences not make sense.. at all. I would find myself re-reading sentences over and over trying to figure out what I was missing, only to discover it was never going to make sense.\n\nI will say it is frustrating to sit down with a book you want to enjoy only to be plagued by errors that could have been prevented had someone read the book before it went to the press.\n\nSummary - Milo is troubled. He hates his brother and is addicted to drugs. When he realizes his life is over in his home town, he moves and starts fresh. There he meets Maya, who was equally as troubled but is clean. She is facing her own demons. Both her parents are dead and her brother is dying. Milo and Maya start dating and learn to trust each other with their secrets and demons.\n\nThe storyline held promise. I was looking forward to reading a book where the characters are imperfect and face challenging times. Unfortunately the execution fell flat. The beginning was good, the middle focused too much on the instant love story, and the end felt scattered and cheesy.\n\nI was hoping to read a book with a relationship that built throughout. Again the beginning of the book held promise of that. Milo even stated that he was going to chase Maya. I liked the idea of seeing him woo her, but no... apparently there is no chase they just fall madly in love with each other before the first date even starts..\n\nOne problem that annoyed me was how the author flipped on Joey. Here is a young woman who sees a troubled young man and tries to help him. He didn't want to go to the meetings and found it difficult to stay clean. She helped him through those times. She was his best friend, like his family. She was likable at the beginning of the book. Enter Maya.. as soon as Milo has Maya in his life his perception of Joey changes, but only when Maya has a problem with her. I feel the author turned on Joey at this point. She made Joey come across as selfish, rude, and unlikable. There is even a moment where Milo completely turns on her. Some people find that having a sponsor is more helpful to them than going to meetings. Others find the opposite helpful. Who are we to judge how someone is able to get and stay clean? That upset me.\n\nBy the time I hit the middle of the book I was upset with the direction it was taking, but even the story seemed to slow in its pace. I was struggling to get through the middle and the end. It became way too cheesy for me. I wanted more than the instant cheesy love story that was delivered.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I felt like I was reading a contemporary romance, but a good one. I was intrigued by the storyline, liked the characters, and was even surprised by an added element at the end.\n\nSummary - Jona has spent the last 12 years of her life in an orphanage because her mother dropped her off there. Jona is bitter, she has turned to the streets and gets caught quite frequently. After getting caught this last time her sentence is to live with her mother, aunt, and her uncle in France. While there her mother seeks for forgiveness and she makes a friend in Julian.\n\nLike I said I felt like 98% of this book is a contemporary romance, but when I reached the end I realized there was a paranormal aspect to it. Normally the paranormal is something I really have to be in the mood to read and it has to be really well done for me to enjoy it. With this book it makes up such a small part and it is done well that I didn't mind it at all.\n\nOne thing I am going to harp on is the amount of mistakes. I debated rating it 3 stars just for that reason, but the story was a good one so I nixed that idea. I just feel like mistakes take away from the ease of reading. I want to sit down and immerse myself in a book, not to be drawn from it by rough sentences.\n\nThe love story is really well done. I liked that it was a relationship that felt realistic and grew through the entire book. Jona and Julian really get to know each other and learn to trust in one another.

It does not deserve a place on the children's classics.  There are a number of problems with the book.  First off, it's a dull tale.  It could have been exciting--the tale of two children running away from home and living in a museum--but it ends up being mundane.  There is precious little suspense in the story, and the children never seem overly concerned about getting caught.\n\nIndeed, the children do not seem overly concerned about very much at all.  They give scant thought to their parents (who after a hours would be going crazy--after a week would suffer psychological damage).  They think little about lying, betrayal, cheating at cards, swindling a friend's money at cards, stealing coins from the museum fountain, trespassing, or the harm they might be causing others. Such problems can be excellent fodder for a novel!  Who wants angelic characters?  BUT such problems need to be confronted and overcome--not ignored.  In short, they address almost none of the moral dilemmas posed by the novel.  They just drift through the plot in a narcissistic manner.\n\nAs if recognizing the tedium of her own tale Konigsburg gives us the mystery of the Angel statue.  It is an implausible and poorly resolved mystery which never adds much momentum to the story.  My 6 year old and I were not dying to find out the answer to the mystery.  The novel's apex comes when Frankweiler and Claudia conspire in secrecy and share the potency of secrets.  It's a powerful notion, but there is a risk is glorifying secrecy for children.  Having a personal, burning secret can be a source of pride and intrigue, but it can also be a harmful tumor.  As with all of the moral issues in the book, Konigsburg does not address the multi-edged nature of secrecy.  Undeserving of the Newbury, this novel is now undeserving of our further attention.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There, in my gray matter, after three decades, remained a sense of unease with this book.  Now, having read the book aloud to my daughter, I can see what went wrong.  This book has on every page jokes and vocabulary that would challenge my college students.  And yet the book is targeted to small children.  Let me throw you a few examples: The Senses Taker, Dynne (a play on \"din\" and \"djinn\"), Kakofonous A. Dischord Doctor of Dissonance.  Some needlessly tough words: salve, disdainfully, brandishing, gelatinous, and countless more.\n\nTo be fair, there are a great many things accessible to children, such as (literally) jumping to (the island of) Conclusions, the watchdog (a dog with a clock in his middle), and Alec, the floating boy who is growing down.  Moreover, the Jules Feiffer illustrations are superb.  They greatly help to make sense of the difficult concepts in this work.\n\nCharitably, one could say that the author intended a whole set of bon-mots for the adult reader, and a more innocent story for the young.  But I don't think this is the case.  I think that Juster terribly overshot his audience and created a book better for adults than children.  For those determined to read this book, reserve it for older children who are very strong readers.  This is not a book that translates well to the young.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.5}, {"id": "21524", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nTwo years ago, I had purchased the The Wolfgang Deep Gloss Total Concours Kit which includes the autobathe, clay bar, clay lubricant, paintwork polish enhancer, deep sealant 3.0, and instant detail spritz for my spouse to use on his beloved Mugen Milano Red 2010 Honda Fit. Unfortunately, that car was totaled in a rear end collision, and he was unable to use the kit as intended. Fast forward to the present, we needed a new car, and ended up buying a 2016 Aegean Blue Honda Civic that looks very sporty. Immediately, my husband washed, polished, and sealed the car using his Wolfgang kit and PORTER-CABLE 7346SP 6-Inch Orbital Polisher. The car of course looked absolutely stunning, but more importantly, weekly and monthly maintenance is much simpler after adding the sealant.\n\nAUTO BATHE-In terms of the Auto Bathe solution, my husband used the recommend amount for a bucket of water, and felt that the 1 oz recommended amount was overkill for one bucket. He said half would do a great job for next time. In terms of the cleaning properties, he liked it a lot more than the cost effective Armor all brand shine and wax auto bath that he's used in the past. He said that the soapy water was more soapy for the amount of solution that he put in the bucket, and that he would need to add a lot of the armor all brand car wash to create the same amount of soap. He said that the auto bath had a pleasant smell to it, but more importantly he felt that the auto bath did a great job of cleaning dirt off the car. Since the car we have is brand new, it was hard to assess its cleaning abilities, but since my parents recently visited from L.A., my husband said that the bath cleans really well when it was used on their 2004 honda civic after a 6 hour road trip. Although more expensive that other brands, my husband said that if he were to use 1/2 an ounce for each car bath, given its a 16 oz bottle, and that he washes the car from head to toe at most once a month, it should last him at least 24-30 months. And for that many baths, he said he felt the extra cost to have a good, thorough clean was worth it.\n\nCLAY BAR/CLAY BAR LUBRICANT-Althought the clay bar does what a clay bar is supposed to do and there was nothing spectacualr about it, it is very important to have for someone serious about detailing their car. Since my husband wanted to learn how to use the kit right, he watched an hour YouTube video about the the wolfgang product line, where he learned about the importance of claying the car, especially if its been awhile. According to the instructional video, claying the car allows you to remove, dirt, grime, and other foreign material that have embedded themselves on the surface of your car and do not come off after washing. If you do not clay the car, the polish, sealant, of wax you add to the surface will not adhere as well if the embedded materials are not removed first. One tip as described in the Youtube Video is to take the bar, break it into 3 or 4 pieces, and turn those pieces into pancake looking discs which are easier to clean with. VERY IMPORTANT!! Never use the clay bar by itself, and always use the lubricant on the surface of the car and on the clay bar itself.\n\nPAINTWORK POLISH ENHANCER & DEEP GLOSS PAINT SEALANT 3.0- Once the car is clean, clayed, and dried, find a cool spot to apply the bread and butter of the Wolfgang kit. Keep in mind that if you have a beat up or older car, you should instead use a compound and swirl remover solution prior to polishing the car. Since we have a newer car however, the polish enhancer and sealant 3.0 were fine. VERY IMPORTANT!! After application of the sealant, let it sit for 40-50 min in a cool area. He made the mistake on first use of wiping away the sealant after maybe only 15-20 min not knowing any better, and apparently the 45 minutes are supposed to help the sealant BOND to the cars surface. A good way of knowing if its ok to wipe of is the \"finger test\". You wipe with one finger across a part of your car with the sealant on the surface after the 45 min are done. If you wipe and it is still creamy and seems like running a finger through mayo, its not ready. There should be a shiny, clean surface when you wipe away the sealant.\n\nINSTANT DETAIL SPRAY-The sealant can take 3-4 strong car washes before starting to come off. Thats about one a month, so application every 3-4 months is advised. There are wax/sealant friendly car wash solutions out there that can extend the life of the sealant/wax. One of those is the Instant Spray Detail Spray that is included in the Wolfgang kit. Its been over two months since waxing the car, and though my husband is the one mostly responsible of maintaining the interior and exterior of the car, I have cleaned the exterior of the car occasionally using the Instant Spray Detailer which my husband, and myself love to use. He of course uses the spray liberally at least once a week, and has already ordered the 128 oz refill as well as the spray sealant to supplement orbitally sealing the car every 3-4 months. In the few occasions I myself have used the detailer, I've noticed quite a few aspects of the detailer spray that I like.\n\n1) The smell of the detailer is nice and not offensive in any way. Being around different car cleaning chemicals in the past, those with a strong or offensive chemical odor just make me not want to clean the car at all. Since the detailer has a nice smell to it, I don't mind at all being the one to \"detail\" the car every once in a while.\n\n2) The shine and clean surface that the spray leaves behind are amazing, especially if you've done some compounding, polishing, sealing, or waxing work before hand. My parents made a visit from L.A., and we used the detailer on there 2004 blue civic when they got here, and after my husband orbitally compounded, polished, and waxed their car. The detailer cleans and shines but it definitely amplifies previous detailing work that has been done to the car even more.\n\n3) Because the detailer spray can be used on glass, plastic, and pretty much any part of the car, my husband said that he was able to get some stubborn glass water stains that remained from his first car wash using the detailer spray. He said it was pretty easy to do, and didn't involve as much manual pressure as he though. He just made sure to let the solution sit for a bit before cleaning the car.\n\nOverall, this is en excellent kit, with excellent quality items that may seem pricey up front, but are a good deal when you get them all together at once. If you are serious about auto detailing and maintenance, this is exactly what you need. Keep in mind that you need to supplement this kit with other car care items as needed for glass, rims, tires, plastic, leather, etc. But in terms of the actual paint of the car, unless you have an older or beat up car that requires the use of the compound and swirl remover solution, this kit gives you everything you need for a cleaner, shinier, car.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I was debating whether to buy it because of the price, and the fact that my husband needed to install it and I wasn't sure how complex it would get (don't want him to break our sink/kitchen). Up to when I had purchased this filter, I had been doing fine buying filtered water at the grocery store and using a water stand since we only needed to refill three 5 gallon bottles maybe once every 2-3 weeks. But we went ahead and made the investment, and so far it has been a really great decision. Regarding the installation, the kitchen and sink area definitely did get messy. I'll go over some of the issues that my husband faced when installing the filter.\n\n1) You need to make sure you have the right drill bits to drill a hole through your sink. Whether porcelain or stainless steel, you need the right tools to get a hole through your sink without creating any extra damage. If you make an awkward sized hole, the water tap may not properly seal and water may drip under the sink.\n\n2) Make sure you are comfortable with tools, drilling holes into your sink drain, and drilling holes into the sides of the sink cabinet to install the filtration system. not so much for the sides but some people may not like the idea of drilling a hole into the sink drain which you have to.\n\n3) My husband had a VERY hard time because of the angle of the faucet and sink drain connecting the cold water metal connection that connects to the filter. Hopefully your sink is spacious, because if it's small or cramped with weird angles, some tubing and parts of the installation that require tightening nuts may be tricky.\n\n4) Lastly, you have to be confident that once you start the project you will finish it, and that you will do it correctly. There are so many tubes and connections throughout the filter installation that involve so many areas such as the water line, sink drain, and the filter itself, that there are many possible areas for leaks, disconnects, and other issues. You can't just install and leave it, for the first two days after install, there was a total of 2 leaks that occurred. Two were due to tubes not being properly pushed all the way in, and a one took some time to develop and was hard to spot at first. It needs to be installed right because realistically if you leave home for hours on end, or for a long vacation, the connections need to be right or else it just takes one tube to POP and there goes your savings.\n\nOther than these points, as other reviewers have said, the water filtration and taste is excellent. The water appears crystal clear, and health wise it is an excellent investment since I find myself drinking a lot more water and taking water from home since it is so easily accessible. I hope my review has been helpful, enjoy your filter if you buy one!\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 3.37}, {"id": "21525", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nSeen the movie on Netflix, so I knew what I was purchasing beforehand.

The interior is coated with adhesive so the moths become trapped after entering the house.

There are points in this story at which you can wonder if we are going to get our HEA.  Both Elizabeth and Darcy reach a point at which they consider if they are fair to make each other keep their word to marry...both wonder at how the other can put up with so many affronts, so many rude comments, so many in each family not happy with this engagement.\n\nAs others have said there are no new characters and the story follows much of canon.  But the step-by-step process of really getting to know each other, of learning to be open and also accepting each other with good and bad traits displayed is very well done here.  And we also read some realities about other characters, i.e., Mr. Bennet accepting his role in the whole dowry debacle and in changing his mind about Brighton.\n\nWell done and despite the high price a book not to be missed.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Few books do that to me.  I read this book due to seeing it recommended on Goodreads and then reading the Amazon reviews and the Sample.\n\nI know we have all read or heard about people who have met with near death experiences and how, usually, the life goals, the values, the meaning of life are changed in a deep and lasting way.  Darcy has such an experience and it is one which gives him months to dream, to contemplate and to plan.  He also updates his will and writes letters to all who might need to know his wishes.\n\nThis book has many parallels to canon but there are several differences: one is that the Netherfield Ball is now a masquerade and another is the resulting duel as Wickham is found seducing one of the guests.  I don't want to post spoilers here but will add that this author does a good job with slight changes to or new happenings.  I really liked reading the thought processes from both Elizabeth's and Darcy's POV.  Elizabeth's powers of observations as to even the type of clothing worn by her mystery man and then discernment about subtle changes in behavior bringing realizations as to who is lying and manipulating circumstances were well written.  Darcy's eavesdropping does, as we all know it will, bring pain but also achieves what the Hunsford proposal did in canon.  Darcy does a good deal of soul searching and gains some insights.  He acts as a man of honor and justice and protection towards those he cares about.\n\nThe only chord which might read as out-of-tune was the affect of the final lie from Wickhams mouth.  It might be interpreted as Wickham putting in one last effort to wound Darcys soul as he did his body but then, although Darcy had moments of misgivings about Elizabeth which were disappointing, they were just that, MOMENTS, immediately after which he did suggest an anvil visit to Elizabeth.\n\nI would have liked more at the endespecially of the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth, even the reaction of friends and family.  And I do love epilogues.that heir to Pemberley, etc.  But overall this is a book which I will say I do recommend to all.

Overly long, to me, sub-plotted to within an inch of its life. But much of it grabs and holds the heart and the mind. Why only four stars? One thinks some of it could have been thinned out.

The book is not unduly long and could not have been shortened without leaving out needed things. (I confess that I did not cope well with the Norwegian names, all of which and all of whose connections are hard to remember and take into account as one moves along in the tale, with everything coming together toward the end. I did better the second time through.) This book is not only fascinating and gripping in its own right, but essential to understanding Harry Hole's key romantic relationship, started here and integral to what else happens, played out in subsequent novels. Without spoiling things, I cannot reveal why such close attention to what Harry learns here, and thinking about it and who else knows, is so important, but it is. The first two Harry Hole novels are not linked to this, perhaps explaining why they were published later rather than up front. I recommend Redbreast without reservation and it ought to be read first, before getting into the later books. Having done that, read them all.

Who has a girlfriend no one in the family likes, and who doesn't like any of the females in the family. This plot tangent is never dealt with, only mentioned briefly.\n\nHer relatives go on and on about how they can't teach her about demon catching because than the demon will know everything she knows, but they tell her a whole bunch of stuff and let her help with exorcisms anyways. The demon knowing everything that she knows thing is never dealt with.\n\nThere are two incorporeal spirits in her room that only Mia can hear. They show up at random intervals for no particular purpose. Their presence is never explained nor explored.\n\nMia has a five second crush on a guy named Lucifero, a Satanist. He takes her out for coffee, gets possessed by her demon and then after that is sent to the hospital and disappeared off the face of the earth. He and his group-who tried to \"infiltrate\" her family a little earlier in the book-are never heard from again.\n\n~Spoilers end~\n\nWhat DOES happen in the book then, you ask?

But as a die hard Richelle Mead fan, I couldn't resist requesting this when it popped up on Edelweiss. Perhaps it is because I'm such a die hard fan that I couldn't help but be disappointed by this book.\n\nBesides being a huge Mead fan, I picked up this book because the premise seemed freaking fantastic. In this, at least, I wasn't disappointed. Mead has created a huge world with a diverse population-did I mention huge? This book travels like nobody's business. The very idea that the Republic of United North America is cracking down on religions, or as they say \"belief in fictitious entities,\" is really cool-especially because it's obvious right from the get go that there are some larger forces at work. The involvement of the various gods-and especially Justin's ravens-kept me engaged in this book even when everything else wanted to through me out.\n\nThis book is told from multiple points of view, mostly Justin and Mae's. The story is told in the third person, yes, but there still never felt like there was much of a difference between their narrations. The characters themselves came off as a little flat, which was strange because so much time was spent investigating what made them tick. Mead was very thorough in giving background on her characters, and all of them had multiple facets that I enjoyed. But there was still something that kept them from lifting off the page for me, a kind of stiffness that I can't explain. It was quite strange.\n\nThe plot and pacing of the book also seemed to drag on a little. Mead, as usual, is all about plots and subplots, but I wasn't as invested in some of them as I could be. Perhaps it is because some where mentioned in the book but then not really addressed. The character of Tessa bothered me especially, because I didn't understand the point of watching this girl from the provinces adjust to life at high school while Justin and Mae were out playing with gods and murderers. Most times she just seemed like a human plot device, whose actions only facilitated certain events that needed to happen.\n\nOverall, however, I think this was a successful book. I might have gotten bored in places, but I always kept reading. The intrigue with the multiple deities running around kept me hooked, and will keep me hooked for the next book. I would recommend this book for people captivated by the world Mead is creating. It's not one I'd urge you to buy in hardcover (especially because it's an adult book and gollywhiz those prices for hardcovers), but if you see it in paperback or at the library and think it might be interesting, I'd be all over that.\n\n(And if you missed this at the beginning of the review, this is NOT a ya book.

I just this week (Oct. 2014) finished re-reading the book and came across this quote attributed to one of the Belgian nuns when she was talking about the difference between two father's style of preaching:  \"The God of the Old Testament is a God of rules and vengeance.  Ours is more like a father who understands human nature because he created it.  Dogma controls through fear; spirituality through love.  God gives each of us the freedom to choose how we behave in the face of nature's disasters or even our own defeats.\"\n\nI was raised by preachers of the Old Testament where fear is the vehicle of faith.  \"The Shack\" showed me that there can be another way, the way of the New Testament where love really is the guiding light of faith.  The author further states that religion is the invention of man and that God may not be particularly happy about it nor endorse man's creation of religion.\n\nIn fact, to take it even a step  further, it is the difference between beating a child as discipline and disciplining a child through love, patience and guidance.  The first teaches a child \"respect\" through fear and that physical force is the answer to differences and conflict.  The second shows the child the wisdom and patience of a loving parent who approaches the child and his indiscretion with an age-appropriate discussion and a discipline that teaches the lesson through love and appropriate consequences for his actions.\n\nI definitely appreciate and endorse the latter--hands down--every--single--time!

I always remember which songs are released as singles, whether they become major hits or not.  Every time a band puts out a \"greatest hits\" album or a \"best of\" album, they ALWAYS end up leaving off some key songs.  I'm not saying that EVERY single has to make the cut, but at least get all of the successful hits!  Nope, they always leave off 1 or 2 major hits just to anger you enough to go out and buy one more thing to round out your collection.  After all, most of these compilation albums are put together by the record company, the band rarely has much involvement.  Not in this case, though!  Seether did the incredibly obvious thing to do, which also happens to be something very rarely done... THEY PUT EVERY SINGLE ON HERE!\"  I've been listening to these guys since a couple weeks before their first album was released, and I can tell you that they didn't miss anything here.  The first album (Disclaimer) is represented with Fine Again, Driven Under, and Gasoline.  The version of Broken on here is not the original album version; it's the more popular re-recording that they did with Amy Lee from Evanescence.  Then the second album (Karma & Effect) is represented with Remedy, Truth, and The Gift.  From the third album (Finding Beauty In Negative Spaces) we have Fake It, Rise Above This, Breakdown, and the cover of Careless Whisper which was released on later pressings.  Finally, the band's fourth and most recent album is represented with Country Song, Tonight, Here And Now, and No Resolution.  These are all fantastic songs (although I was never crazy about Careless Whisper), and I think this will make all you casual Seether fans very happy!  However, don't be scared to check out the band's individual albums, which are all very solid.  After all, some really great songs like Sympathetic and Fur Cue never made it to the radio.\n\nHowever, things don't end there.  We get a whole other disc containing B-sides and other rare songs from the band.  This is cool for devoted Seether fans like myself, but it would make more sense to release this seperately.  Obviously this was packaged together to ensure sales from both casual AND diehard fans of the group.  (This was probably the record label's idea.)  Oh well, at least the price is cheap!  This disc begins with a cover of Seether, a song originally recorded by Veruca Salt and most likely the inspiration for the band's name.  It sounds pretty good, but it seems a little mellow and I was thinking the band was really gonna rock out with it.  Then there's Safe To Say I've Had Enough and Weak, which I believe are both newly recorded songs.  Out Of My Way and Hang On were recorded for movie soundtracks, but I don't understand why they put these on here since they were included on Disclaimer II.  We also have Let Me Go from the Remedy single, and No Shelter from the NCIS soundtrack.  The rest of the songs are demos from various points in the band's career.  All of this stuff is pretty good if you're a fan of everything else from Seether, it's just nice to have some lost gems.\n\nThis will make a great Christmas gift if you know a big Seether fan out there, or anyone who likes modern mainstream rock.

Let me start off by saying I love the band's major-label debut, \"Fallen\", but this is really for the die-hard Evanescence fans. I did enjoy this package very much, but there were a few things that disappointed me. Here's the rundown...\n\nCD: The band sounded excellent when I saw them in concert during the U.S. leg of this tour. Although they perform well, I don't think they sound as good live as they do on the album, unless you're actually at the concert. Don't get me wrong, the band is VERY talented and Amy Lee is an amazing vocalist, but there are several times during the show when she is struggling to hit notes. I don't think she used \"studio-magic\" when making \"Fallen\" because during the back-stage segement of the DVD, she is singing beautifully. I just think that when she runs around on stage and gets out of breath, it gets hard for her to sing as well. As for the band, they sound fine, with the exception of the guitarist still trying to keep up with the solo's Ben Moody wrote before leaving the group. Ben was an amazing guitar player...the other guys are good to but during \"Going Under\" the solo is a little loose and is only about a quarter of the length as it is on the album. Aside from those things, the disc is really good. The guitars and drums sound very heavy, especially on the opening song \"Haunted\". For this show, the band performed 10 out of the 11 songs from their \"Fallen\" album, as well as 2 b-sides (\"Farther Away\" and \"Breathe No More\") and even a beautiful cover of Korn's \"Thoughtless\". I think these songs alone are worth buying this package for. Finally, the CD ends with a previously unreleased studio track called \"Missing\". It's a very nice song but I wouldn't say it's one of their best ever. Pretty good overall.\n\nDVD: This is the same performance as the one on the CD. Rather than just filming the concert with multiple cameras, lots of effects (such as slow-motion, repeating frames, blurred images) were added to make the performance more dramatic. This could be good or bad, depending on your outlook. I think it's good because it makes the performance more interesting to watch...but it could also be bad because it feels like your watching more of a music video rather than a concert. The backstage footage is pretty interesting, there's no interviews, it's just the band goofing off left and right, but it's pretty funny. You'll see brief cameos from the guys in Seether, Breaking Benjamin and Three Days Grace. Also included on this disc are the band's 4 music videos: \"Bring Me To Life\" / \"Going Under\" / \"My Immortal\" / \"Everybody's Fool\". The videos are good and it's nice to be able to watch them whenever I want.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.38}, {"id": "21548", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nStill using this case, it has been perfect.

When her confidence is sufficiently shaken, put her in airport full of men she'll never see again and watch this normally self-assured and self-possessed woman test herself to see if she's still got \"IT\" by using one of the oldest tricks in the book: a very hot variation on the old bump-into-a-gorgeous-guy-and-dump-your-purse-at-his-feet stunt.\nNow take one haplessly unaware handsome man and put him in Kate's cross-hairs. Special effects wizard Mike Cameron (a Kevin Costner/Judge Reinhold amalgam) is simply minding his own business while waiting for his flight, reflecting upon the state of his long-term bachelorhood and finding it somewhat lacking.

Kate had no qualms about possessing such a classically feminine shape, and seemed very comfortable with herself. Mike certainly loved the way she looked... Watching Mike pursue Kate was very enjoyable. I know I certainly wouldn't mind having a man like that chase after me!\nThere was also a very sweet secondary romance which I think might be interesting to explore as a prequel to this book, as well as potential for turning Kate into Cupid a few more times for Mike's three sisters.\nWhat didn't work for me:\nKate was understandably skittish about getting into a relationship again, especially since doing so put her young son's heart at risk as much as it did hers.

Sydney's grandfather hires the band for Sydney's 23rd birthday aboard an extravagant yacht. And of course one thing leads to another and the story goes on from there.

It's like a cardboard cut out of a character. And then Avery -- not much better. She's an insecure wedding planner who was dumped but gets a makeover by a not gay assistant and insecurities are vanished! It's never clear where she's coming from. She's too insecure but sleeps with Joe the night she meets him, she plans on never seeing him again but he's nice and ends up making out with him, and more wishy-washy actions continue but there's really no drive behind her actions. She had a deadbeat dad and was left at the altar, ok? She was a high powered NY bridal consultant or something like that but only 24 when she left NY. Just - nothing added up, either with their characters or their interactions. Even at the end of the book I don't know why they loved or even liked each other. He saw her freaking out about a scorpion and immediately fell in love? She completely resisted him but fell in love . . . with what? Him being a Travis? It's not really clear. None of the characters were fleshed out in any way - not her sister, not Steven, not Joe, not even Jack or Ella or Hardy or Haven. None of them seemed like the same characters from the earlier books.

Since I've practiced and taught martial arts and close combat methods for over three decades I felt quite comfortable reviewing this book, as I'm very familiar with much of the weaponry described and their use in both martial arts practice and self-defense. So, on to the review...\n\nWhat this book does well is it lists and explains the wide variety of options available to average everyday citizens for arming themselves prior to and during a SHTF event. If you are someone who is unfamiliar with weaponry, both of the lethal and nonlethal varieties, this book would be a handy addition to your bookshelf. The author does a fine job of explaining various common weapons, their potential applications, and their use to the prepper for self-defense. He goes in-depth when explaining the use and function of various firearms (fiction authors who aren't gun owners, please take note), and provides similarly detailed information on knives as well. In addition, there are useful tidbits of info sprinkled throughout the book on a variety of topics from pepper spray to stun guns to improvised and homemade weapons.\n\nMy main beef with this book is that it's just an overview, a short encyclopedia of weaponry. There's not really much tactical information included in the book, and the section on home fortification is woefully inadequate. That being said, I don't believe the author intended this book to be a tactical manual or a field guide to perimeter and physical security, so I think it would be unfair to judge this book by that measure. I only mention it so that potential readers will know what they're getting and not be disappointed with their purchase.\n\nAnd as a martial artist I also had a minor issue with the section on martial arts weaponry. The fact is, most martial arts weapons are useless for self-defense, and not just impractical to carry as the author states. Not that a good stave or short stick can't be used effectively for self-defense; it's just that some of the weapons listed in the book are ridiculous options for self-protection purposes. For example, the author lists weapons like the nunchaku, tonfa, and weighted chain weapons, all of which are unwieldy and rely on outdated and tactically impractical methods for their use. I wish he would have clearly stated that the reader would be much better off with an ASP or a large tactical flashlight for an impact weapon, instead of just listing these weapons and their explanations and leaving the reader to determine their worth for self-defense on their own.\n\nBottom line? If you are already familiar with self-defense firearms, tactical knives, and the various flavors of melee weaponry, you can safely skip this book. But for the reader that is unfamiliar with their self-defense options who wants to explore all manner of self-defense weaponry in a single reading, this book is well worth the purchase price.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I disagree. I've been a women's self defense instructor for over two decades, and crime statistics have consistently shown that one-in-three to one-in-four women will be the victim of a sexual assault in her lifetime. Those are pretty steep odds if you ask me, and based on the stories I've heard from my students, those stats are pretty solid.\n\nCertainly, violent crime rates have been going down since the 90's, but to say you don't need to learn this material is like saying you don't need to wear a seat belt, because the chance of being in a motor vehicle accident is trivial. Personally, I'd rather wear the seat belt and never need it, than need it someday and not be wearing it. And the same goes for learning the physical, mental, and emotional skills of self-defense.\n\nIn my opinion, mental preparedness is more important than physical preparedness in self-defense. And, if I had to recommend just one book for my wife or sister or daughter to read on self-defense, this book would be at the top of my list because it is both realistic and comprehensive in covering the necessary subject matter.\n\nPotential readers should note that this book does not teach actual techniques of self-defense. Thinking you can learn such things from a book is naive - go take a self-defense class if you want to learn physical skills. But what this book does teach, and teach very well, is the other side of self-defense training - psychological and emotional preparedness for a violent confrontation.\n\nIn almost three decades of martial arts and self-defense training and practice, I can count on the fingers of one hand how many martial arts instructors I have met who have addressed the issue of psychological preparedness and tactical awareness in everyday self-defense. Police, military, and executive security personnel are well aware of how important they are, but sadly even the best physical training programs in the civilian sector rarely touch on these topics.\n\nThankfully, now you can read Neal's book and learn what the smartest self-defense instructors teach about mindset, awareness, threat levels and risk assessment as it pertains to personal safety and survival in a violent world. And, he knows his stuff. Not only is the author an instructor under Geoff Thompson, he also has extensive experience working as a night club doorman as well (in the U.S. we call them bouncers). And in this case, good training + lots of real world experience = a very good self defense book.\n\nSo, if you want to learn what you need to know to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally (as much as one can) for surviving a violent encounter, read this book. It's well worth the price, and what you read here could very well save your life someday.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.13}, {"id": "21570", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nAfter 3.5 years of use (dec 2013-june 2017) my countertop brew express has died - the display/controller/electronics are dark/dead. Most likely a surge that did it in as my amazon echo on the same circuit also failed a few weeks earlier. This gives me the opportunity to review the unit from the past years use as I wait for the replacement new unit to arrive.\n\nInstallation was doable but required me to visit the hardware store to find the right diameter line tap/valve to tap my fridges water line that is thicker than usable for the parts that came with the brew express but then it worked.  It having to futz with water is great. I tapped in past my fridges water filter so water was filtered.\n\nI don't use the smaller single cup basket much as my mugs are often taller and I'm fine making 4 cups In the full size and just microwaving to reheat on subsequent days but if you like the coffee fresh it's a good option.\n\nDesign issues do exist. In 201x that this thing has a clock that cannot auto set itself is just inexcusable. Setting the clock is a non trivial thing that will annoy you every time you realize there was a power outage. As you struggle to remember which buttons control clock hours minutes 12/24 mode and the sheer slowness of having to move the clock from minute 31 all the way around the minute 22 ( as always seems to be the case) will have you very frustrated. Come on guys. Put a cell phone/short wave atomic clock radio/ wifi antenna in there and have a way for the thing to get time from one of the host of sources.\n\nButtons, this bubble foil buttons never stile me as quality. Yeah they provide protection against liquids but are just so cheap. And eventually wear out though if the electronics end up dying every 3 years that won't become a problem. Why there is a big mechanical on/off power button on the front top I find insane, as pressing it is never going to be needed and if you do then you must reset that annoying clock. Imagine a big power off button on the front of your bult in microwave/oven system.\n\nAnd now that it died an electronics death that brings up the issue of repair. When it goes, as it's a self contained unit (which is needed for compactness for counter installation and a good thing) it means that unlike my amazon echo I cannot just replace the powerfully to this thing at $30 but must replace the whole unit.\n\nIt's a good unit with some 1980's design thinking (clock and buttons) and if they ever improve that it would be a 5 star product.

Terminator Salvation develops this more than the other movies in the series, focusing more on the human aspects instead of just a hunt.\n\nChristian Bale plays the adult John Connor, but he's not exactly where we thought he'd be when we last saw him. He isn't the head of the resistance, he's close but he's taking orders from others and it seems to chafe at him that he isn't being listened to. On one mission he infiltrates a Cyberdyne laboratory where he discovers the plans to a new terminator series, the T-800 (the Arnold Schwarzenegger model) and he inadvertently releases a new type of cyborg.\n\nSam Worthington play Marcus Wright, a death row prisoner executed before judgment day, but he donated his body to science in the hopes he might do some good in the world. When he wakes up in 2018 he doesn't realize he's changed, he's no longer human, or is he? Is he following his free will or responding to programming?\n\nBryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor isn't given a lot to do except stand around looking matronly (she's pregnant), and be pretty, for some reason she's wearing a lot of make-up that seems a little out of place during an all encompassing war. She isn't even given as much to do as Claire Danes did in Rise of the Machines. Christian Bale plays John Connor as a pretty hard man but even hard men have tender moments with loved ones and Howard's character should  have been the softening agent for Bale to play against. Even Marcus Wright has a more active love interest in Moon Bloodgood (which is a name that sounds lifted from a vampire novel) than John and Kate Connor do.\n\nThe resistance is planning to attack the main outpost of Skynet in San Francisco but Connor discovers that Kyle Reese (his future father) is there and along with Marcus Wright mounts a rescue mission against the orders of the resistance. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese and is a much better in this role than he was in Star Trek, as an effete Mr. Chekov.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter gets to play both ends of the spectrum. At the beginning of the movie she plays a scientist that you have real sympathy for, and at the end she reveals what Marcus Wright's mission was and she seems the evil incarnation of Skynet itself.\n\nThe usual mistake of sequels is they try to reproduce the original movie, Salvation doesn't make that mistake, there are no punchy phrases like \"I'll be back\" (even though it's quickly alluded to) or \"hasta la vista baby.\" At moments the movie seems a hybrid of other movies. Aspects or portions of this movie have influences from Frankenstein, Road Warrior, The Matrix, Transformers, and even The Great Escape. But this isn't a clumsy attempt of trying to stitch a movie together with the left over parts of other movies, Salvation uses those parts to fit into the Terminator world.\n\nTerminator Salvation is well worth seeing and spending your money on.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

TV is now full of shows that have a vision of the series as a whole with a beginning, middle and end fully plotted before they even hit the screen. Shows like Lost, Hero's, Mad Men, and The Sarah Connor Chronicles have changed how we look at TV shows, and maybe the way we should think about them as well.\n\nI have to admit that when the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles went on I was excited, being as I'm a fan of The Terminator movies but as I watched the first couple of episodes I lost interest. Then I applied for a job as book reviewer for an ezine and they also wanted the book reviewer to review a science fiction TV series as well, so I picked The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I didn't get the gig reviewing books for that particular ezine but I watched the entire first season in one or two sittings and was able to view it as  a whole and saw the emerging themes and directions the creators of the show were trying to take, and I got excited about the possibilities they were exploring.\n\nThe Sarah Connor Chronicles picks up after the second Terminator movie. Sarah and John have settled down a bit, Sarah in love and living with a paramedic in Colorado, but they're still doing their best to stay off the grid and not attract attention to themselves. A Terminator shows up at John's school one day as a substitute teacher with a gun implanted in his thigh. When he opens fire and chaos ensues John is saved by Cameron, the cute new girl sitting next to him in class, who seems to be able to take a bullet pretty well. John escapes to the parking lot with the teacher terminator hot on his trail and just as John is cornered Cameron comes out of nowhere with a truck and runs down the terminator, and reveals herself to be a terminator sent by the future John Connor to save his teenage self. John and Cameron find Sarah but the police and the not quite terminated terminator are in hot pursuit of the three of them. Cameron leads them to a bank vault a seeming dead end, but the future John Connor has been planning ahead (or is it behind?) and he's been sending emissaries back in time to set up an infrastructure to protect himself in the past. Cameron rips open safety deposit boxes and starts assembling a device, a time machine, Cameron is going to hide John and Sarah in the future!\n\nAfter the escape to the future John convinces Sarah and Cameron that they can do more than wait for judgment day that they can again go after Skynet and destroy it before it can be built. They also discover that the terminator after John at the school got caught in the time vortex they went through so he's still after them, although he's a bit beat up and needs to reconstitute himself. Another antagonist FBI agent James Ellison is introduced, a police detective who believes Sarah Connor killed some police officers, and this addition has kind of The Fugitive feel to it and never really develops anything passed that.\n\nSarah soon discovers a computer prototype called The Turk that could become Skynet and built by a computer geek Andy Good, but she is able to torch it and unfortunately Andy's dreams. But John Connor isn't the only one salting away things in the past to change the future, Skynet is also stashing things such as a type of steel to build terminators. Sarah discovers that Andy has rebuilt The Turk and she runs off to destroy it (again) but finds she's too late that The Turk has been stolen and Andy Good has been killed by Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle who came back in the first Terminator movie to save her. Derek joins Sarah and John but is distrustful of Cameron and her motives because she is terminator but also because he knew her in the future and isn't convinced she doesn't have a hidden agenda, and some of her actions might indicate she has something to hide, Derek and Sarah discover that Cameron has kept a chip from a terminator but is she keeping it for Skynet's agenda? Or does she have a secret mission from the future John Connor?\n\nIn one of the more interesting episodes Bruce Davison plays another of his characters bordering on insanity. He's the psychiatrist at the mental institution Sarah escaped from in the second movie and he's stolen a hand from a terminator and Sarah is in a race to retrieve it before FBI agent Ellison does. In the penultimate episode of the season the doubts about Cameron finally come to the surface when it is discovered she saved the chip she was supposed to destroy. Cameron's motivations and actions increasingly are under scrutiny by Sarah. In the final episode Sarah and gang are offered the chance to buy the Turk for half a million dollars, and Sarah's love interest returns, and in the cliffhanging last scene Cameron is blown up by a truck bomb.\n\nI hadn't heard of most of the cast before The Sarah Connor Chronicles but in researching this review I found that most of them have pretty solid television credibility having appeared on Hero's, Firefly, and The 300, all pretty solid shows with reputations for smart episodes, so it seems the cast was picked well. The acting is uniformly good it doesn't delve into kitsch or melodramatics and the possibility always exists for those roads to be taken. Brian Austin Green who started his career in the great Spelling schmaltz factory of 90210 had me worried when he came into the show in the third or fourth episode as Derek Reese but he has consistently shown that he has the capabilities of good acting and has even carried the dramatics in a couple of the episodes.\n\nAllusion and metaphor aren`t found in a lot of TV shows, in a smartly written show you can find one or the other but not usually both. In the Sarah Conner Chronicles chess is used as a metaphor, and yes, I know chess is an overused metaphor in a lot of things but they didn't belabor the point and it worked in the context of the episode. The themes that are explored in The Sarah Conner Chronicles are more ambitious than in the Terminator movies. The show explores do the terminators cause people to act more machine like? Can machines learn to love man enough to need them? Can man love (come to terms with) his need for machines?\n\nEach of the three DVD's have bonus features that are quite a fun enhancement to the set. I enjoyed the actor audition video's especially Lena Headey's. She's an English actress and she effects an American accent quite well and believably but as soon as she drops out of character her English accent is noticeable and almost undecipherable!\n\nI think anyone who liked The Terminator movies and wants to explore that world a little deeper will certainly enjoy this series, as well as someone not all that knowledgeable about The Terminator world.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 3.24}, {"id": "21572", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nMy daughter's two demonic cats love this toy.

It continues the exploits of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Schroeder (the latter two have grown up quite a bit since the first volume from 1950 to 1952) as well as Linus, who although still a baby begins to show the intelligence that would be a large part of his personality for the life of the strip.  We see Pig-Pen introduced in this volume as well as what many Peanuts fans consider the \"lost character\", Charlotte Braun.  This character, who appeared for about a two-week stretch in late 1954 and was never heard from again had the fussbudget personality that was later assumed by Lucy.  Having only seen one strip with Charlotte before getting this book, I have to say that Charlotte was annoying in her short tenure in the strip and Charles Schulz probably knew it was best to cut his ties with the character.  But she still is a fascinating part of Peanuts history.\n\nIf you get this book, you will notice that the quality of the reproduction of some of the strips are less than average.  There is an explanation in the book that many of the early strips were lost from the Schulz collection and that there are not many copies of newspapers around to pull the strips from (their next best option) and that microfilm (where most newspapers are usually kept) is usually not acceptable for reproduction.  So for some strips, they used the best they had.  Sure, it would be nice to have pristine copies, but at least I'm glad something is there.\n\nAll-in-all, it is another masterpiece and I can't wait for the next volume, which will be the strips of 1955 and 1956!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

And again, it is a terrific tribute to two years of the man's work, this time chronicling the years 1957 and 1958.  Of the four books published to date, this book had many more strips which I was familiar with than the other three.  But there were still quite a few strips that I have never seen before, making it another fun reading experience.  The strip quality is better in general in this volume as it appears the publishers had access to quality masters to provide reproductions than they had in previous versions (I only noticed one strip that looked a little blurred in this book).  Obviously if you have the other three books, you'll be getting this one and you can expect more of the same great quality.\n\nIt was also nice to see that the publishers have kept their word where they said that if they found better or more complete strips that they would republish them in future books.  In this book, they republish a strip from the second volume where they didn't have a complete strip (they actually had to have an artist draw the missing panels).  But somebody out there had the complete strip and it has been republished here and is fully documented.\n\nMy only complaint about the books is that 2 books a year just isn't fast enough!

So much fun I will absolutely NEVER return to sitting inside a boat.  In fact my kayaks are just collecting dust unless guests are in town.  I saw orange Koi in the Potomac River only b/c I was standing to paddle yet - by the end of most paddle adventures - either the wind or waves kick up and I'm thankful for the option to sit.  Was kayaking 2-4x a month off season and 5-7x/week in season, so this purchase was to help me decide if standing and the workout factor would even appeal to me.  If so, I knew this would make a nice option for people to come along once I upgraded (which I'm shopping for now).

On board, I wear flip flops in summer and neoprene boots with socks off season and I have ever slipped even with no deck padding.

I purchased a seat from Austin Kayaks and love it b/c it has all the room I need for anything an all I would want:  sunscreen, binoculars, snacks, water bottle.  The deck cord behind the seat is where I store my kayak blades -- I too read how the Taboo paddle was a great compromise for this SUP, but do not fall for that.  This board performs better kayaking with a true kayak blade and stand up paddling with a SUP paddle.  I will say this, the Taboo forces much more water past the boat b/c it's gigantic compared to most SUP blades, but...the weight makes it excruciating to paddle over an hour.  If there was any pit fall to this board I'd have to say it's the weight.  But, carbon fiber boards are too fragile for those of us newbies still working out how to load/unload and put in without drops.  This is why I love this board.  For me this was a win win, and should I ever tire of it, there is always someone new entering the sport willing to purchase the board off Craigs List.

The game has a \"Training Ground\" scenario, which is actually the outbreak scenario from the first game, abbreviated, so that you can learn the controls.\n\nThe first real scenario is \"Wild Things,\" which takes place in a zoo. It's a lot of fun, except it's very annoying to have the elephant chase you around. But the mutant tigers and heyenas are pretty cool. The second scenario, \"Underbelly,\" takes place in a subway. It has tick-like monsters that grow when fired upon, which is very interesting. The third scenario is my favorite, called, \"Flashback.\" It takes place in an abandoned hospital in the middle of a forest. It's very ominous, and a masked man chases you with a hammer! It involves plant monsters, and has awesome zombies with flowers growing out of their heads!\n\nThe fourth scenario, \"Desperate Times,\" takes place in the police department of Resident Evil 2 and 3 fame. It's cool to see an upgraded, PS2 version of the station. There are intriguing puzzles that don't interfere with the continuity of the other games, and actually help to enhance it. The annoying thing is that rooms are pumped full of gas at random that will harm you, and you must use special canisters to counteract the affects of the gas. The fifth and final scenario, \"End of the Road,\" moves from a secret lab, to the sewers, to the streets of Raccoon City, from the \"Outbreak\" scenario in the first game. It's great to see the Tyrant protecting you for a change, and it also features the return of the hunters.\n\nAs with the first game, the virus meter is very annoying, and largely dictates the pace of the game, since you need to acquire as many health items as possible and use them quickly.

The graphics are flawless, however, the controls take some getting used to. Also, some of the zombie sounds are recycled from Resident Evil games of the 90's. You'd think they'd be able to afford to record new sounds by now! And the virus meter is very annoying. The first scenario, Outbreak, takes place on the streets of Raccoon city, reminiscent of Resident Evil 2 and 3. The only problem with it is that there is seemingly an endless supply of zombies, who can open doors. The second scenario, Below Freezing Point, is a lot of fun, as it takes place in Umbrella's secret lab from Resident Evil 2 and 0. The third scenario, The Hive, takes place in a hospital, I think the same one from Resident Evil 3. The only problem with this scenario is that there's a monster that always follows you around, and it reminded me of the Leech Monster from Resident Evil 0. The fourth scenario, Hellfire, takes place in a burning hotel, and is very cool, since it features the return of the Lickers. The fifth and final scenario is called Decisions, Decisions. It takes place at Raccoon University, and has many routes to explore. I haven't played it online, so I can't comment on that aspect of it.

After looking around the new B3- seemed to fit the bill - and I could get it in Red to replace the red Senseo! Firstly - cups are more than the pods - about twice the price. Have not tried the pod holster in this machine yet - so, do not know how it will work but intend to do so. Do not like the quirky start up procedure and the fact that when you remove the used cup it turns itself back on and begs for more water by popping its top. While it seems well built the popping open and snapping shut has me worried. would also like the ability to make different cup sizes (ie fill more or less to start with) as with the larger machines - you do not have to have the reservoir to make this happen! I saw this written over and over again when Senseo came out - do these companies realize that in the USA we drink larger/mugs of coffee? Lastly, it does not produce a hot cup of coffee regardless of what the optimum brew temp might be. I have tried the My K Cup adapter = no leaks as other have experience but it does not get all the coffee wet - I mean, look at the K cups - they become pressurized and coffee is forced out the small piercing in the bottom. It cannot escape too quickly. the My K cup allows coffee (weak) to escape quicker w/o draining the flavor from the coffee - it just kind of flows through the basket rather than being forced through. the old percolators worked this way but they pumped the water through the coffee basket multiple times - not just once. But, what do you expect from a company that sells the machines at cost (?) in order to sell their coffee - they should offer a device that can use any cheaper ground coffee and get the same results? Guess not. Better design would get the job done though - maybe just two sides of fabric on the basket? Overall - the B30 is an attractive machine on the counter, especially in the colors offered with its chrome trim, seems well built - time will tell and you can get a wide variety of K Cups if you want to spend the extra money for the convenience. Drawbacks - no where near hot enough (this unit has less wattage than the bigger brothers do) no way to increase cup size except to go through the cycle again with less water. I am hoping the pod adapter will provide decent results making this a more attractive machine to me.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It means finding something flexible but yet with some rigidity, and something with shock absorption but not a lot of excess bulk. It also means finding a case with a larger lip covering the screen, and a case that is easy to grip.

I was absolutely delighted when it arrived and I realized it fit the bill perfectly.

Is it not? So much so that we - the ones who are educated almost take it for granted. A privilege of sorts. We can never imagine not being literate. To us, that is the core of everything, which as I said often gets overlooked for whatever reason. I tried teaching someone once a long time ago, taught him to read a little and to me that remains closest to my heart. It was not much but it mattered and reading \"Bitter Almonds\" by Laurence Coss brought back all those memories all over again. The idea that a book can do that is sufficient enough for me to keep reading, to keep turning those pages, as I pick one great book after another and that is the power and hold that books and reading have on me.\n\n\"Bitter Almonds\" to put it simply is a book where one woman teaches another how to read and write. Having said this, just as any other book that look deceptively simple, this one too has many layers to it, which will warm the cockles of your heart (so to say) as you get further into the narrative. The story is based in Paris and centered on two women - Edith and Fadila, her sixty-year-old housemaid (an immigrant from Morocco), who is completely illiterate.\n\nEdith doesn't understand how a person can be illiterate. She doesn't get how Fadila must be undertaking the day to day activities of life without knowing how to read or write. Edith then takes it on herself to ensure Fadila is educated and in the right manner. It is not going to be an easy task for Edith and yet at the end of it all and during the lessons, there forms an unexplainable bond between the two women - like they have known each other for years and lifetimes across this one. The thought processes, the emotions, the lives merge and this how they find their friendship, which is both delightful and heartbreaking.\n\nThis is the kind of book that I had wanted to read for a very long time by Laurence Coss, more so after reading, \"A Novel Bookstore\" which is not only unusual in its plot but also highly satisfying as a novel. Of course one cannot compare the two books; however, \"Bitter Almonds\" is in a league of its own. Coss takes us into the hearts and minds of these women and lets us know what friendship and love is all about. She simply describes the world and the relationship of these two women in the book - the way it is - without boundaries and the time it takes for them to trust each other.\n\n\"Bitter Almonds\" is written with great care and tenderness and maybe that is why it speaks to you the way it does. The translation by Alison Anderson is but of course superlative, given that I also loved her translation of \"The Elegance of the Hedgehog\" by Muriel Barbery. It is very important that the translation speak to the reader with the same intensity that the original would, had I known how to read French.\n\nThe book spoke to me on many levels - of not being able to make sense of life when one doesn't know how to read or write (and I shudder at the thought if I was ever illiterate), of maybe the need to help someone or change a person's life (because I also think that we do not do that enough) and of the basic connection of the soul and heart beyond language and literacy.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There is something beguiling about them and at the same time they seem to want to say it all. Whether it is a characterization of Lizzy Bennett or it is Madame Bovary, each woman is almost a world in her own sense. There are also women who are caught in circumstances beyond their understanding and will and sort of emerge with different shades of personalities.\n\nThere are women who are single and lonely and need that extra bit of life so to say, something which will complete them. This I noticed in the works of Muriel Spark more often than not and sometimes also when Iris Murdoch wrote of them. The point that I am trying to get to here is that literature is full of these fascinating characters, one of them I will add to my list, after reading, \"The Woman Upstairs\" by Claire Messud.\n\nClaire Messud's woman is Nora Elridge. Nora is forty-two years old, a teacher and fully enraged at life, when the novel begins. She wants more out of life and doesn't know how to do it. She wants to get out of the rut and doesn't know where to go. She wants children. She wants a life of her own. She doesn't want to be the \"woman upstairs\" who is desperate and longs for more, as days pass, living in a house that has no one else but her in it.\n\nAt the same time, the novel jumps to five years ago, in 2004 when Nora meets the Shahid family and she begins to fall in love with each member of the family - Reza her third-grade student, Sirena the mother, and finally with Skandar - Sirena's husband and Reza's father. This goes on for a year, the one single year that changes Nora's life. This in brief is the plot of the novel.\n\nNow to the style of writing of the book. The plot is so well-layered that the mystery element of the book hits you unexpectedly and that to me is some great writing skill. The thin line between fiction and reality is explored brilliantly through this book and throughout it as well. Messud's understanding of her characters and the lives they lead is beyond excellence, because she delivers with almost every single word and that is what matters when reading a great book. Anger at all levels is reflected in the book in a very subtle and sometimes quite apparently. At the same time, there is enough intellectual depth to the book, which takes it away from being just another psychological thriller. As a reader, I was always drawn to Nora while reading the book. What would she do? How would it affect her? Should she do this at all? When a reader gets so involved with the central character, he or she knows that the book has done its bit.\n\nNora almost speaks to everyone and it is also frightening given the way she lives her life. One doesn't know what is beneath the surface, till it is either revealed or one is smart enough to catch on to the hints. You will love Nora and at times also hate her - that to me is a great sign of etching a character that everyone can or almost wants to relate with and yet maintain their distance. The ending is not tidy. Messud does not even tie up the loose ends. It is for the reader to decipher what could happen and what has. The psychological inferences are many and enhance the reading experience. The cultural inferences only add to those, making the novel richer by the turn of the page.\n\nThe book is profound, deep and at the same time touches on the concept of \"living\" like no other book I have read in recent times. If you are up to read something that will probably make you think a lot, then this book is for you.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.51}, {"id": "21621", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThere are not many books that draw me in so easily, so willingly.

The characters and surrounding world that she created for them were so vivid that I felt as though I could be there myself from the very first page.  The story revolves around Ari Mitchell, who starts off the novel nearing her junior year in high school.  Her best friend, Summer, is happy to be there for Ari, even though she left their Brooklyn high school to attend Hollister, a prestigious Manhattan high school.  When Ari gains the opportunity to also attend Hollister, one would think that life would be great for two best friends who can once again be together.  Predictably, however (but not in a bad way), Summer doesn't take too well to Ari being there, owing mainly to the fact that Ari quickly made a new friend, Leigh, who is not Summer's definition of the \"right type of people.\"  Summer warns Ari of Leigh's past - how she killed her boyfriend, how she's a drunk, etc. - but Ari goes on being friends with her, learning truths about Leigh and Summer all the while.  When Ari becomes enveloped in a relationship with Leigh's cousin Blake, after having harbored a short, but meaningful crush on his brother, Del, things become more complicated than Ari could have ever thought they would.\n\nI thought that Ari's family was well-written.  It was intriguing to see how she handled her crush on her brother-in-law Patrick (her sister Evelyn's husband).  Watching how she dealt with that made her journey in terms of how she interacted with Blake come full circle.  Patrick was there for her at the beginning and end to make her see what she really wanted in terms of a man, but she just had to do her utmost to find that in someone else.  Maybe she'd find it in Blake, and maybe she wouldn't, but as the novel went on, she learned about herself, progressing through her last two years of high school and first couple years of college with certain levels of uncertainty, anger, depression, and eventually faith.  Despite the way her relationships gained traction and then stumbled, everything she goes through in the novel brings her to a satisfying conclusion for herself and how she plans to look back on life and find strength in it in terms of moving forward, no matter the ending she had at the end.\n\nBeth Rodgers, Author of 'Freshman Fourteen,' a Young Adult Novel\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Summer is the daughter of two military parents, and even though everyone around her sees them as heroes, Summer cannot seem to come to terms with this fact.  To her, they are just her parents - people who are tearing her away from the first home she has lived in over several years that she has not wanted to leave.  Leaving her best friend Esmerelda and the people and places she knows does not seem like it will be easy, but there is no getting out of it.\n\nWhen the family makes the move to Valencia, California, Summer must learn to transform herself into a strong-willed young woman, as her entrance into sixth grade looms ever closer.  When her mom is deployed yet again, Summer grapples with feelings of anger at her mother for leaving the family, and insecurity at not being able to make friends during this transitional time in her life.  Eager to join the swim team, her parents sign her up before her mom's deployment, and she begins her competitive career.  The coach, in tune with Summer's needs, and trying to help her succeed to the best of her ability, gives his team pep talks.  His focus stems around encouraging his team to be flexible, fearless, and focused - three traits that Summer finds herself being more accomplished in as the novel goes on.\n\nHer flexibility comes about in terms of a metaphor that the author has injected into the novel - a hummingbird.  Early on in the novel, as Summer and her family first move into their new home, she comes across a hummingbird, which she describes to be \"fearlessly hovering\" in front of her.  She \"can't believe how fast its wings are - flexible - and colorful!\"  She wonders \"if their flexibility is what makes them able to be so quick and so fearless.\"  Watching Summer evolve as the novel progressed, into a smart, focused, and driven young woman constantly reminded me of the description of the hummingbird from earlier on in the storytelling.  Summer finds flexibility in her new life while her mother is away, she finds the courage to be fearless, and she remains focused on her goals, all the while remaining hopeful that her life will not veer too far off the path that she has liked it being on so far.\n\nVeda Stamps crafted a realistic, courageous, and metaphorical tale of hope, strength, and love, and I am eager to read more of her work.  The read was quick and full of encouraging ideas, as well as the normal middle school drama, that make reading young adult and middle grade novels so worthwhile.\n\nBeth Rodgers, Author of 'Freshman Fourteen,' A Young Adult Novel\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.0}, {"id": "21622", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis color was marked way down, so I gave it a try.

I like the Mad Scientists' Club because it does bring youth and science together, not too involved, more pragmatic than theoretical and also involves humor or attempts to. This book is one of a group, I have read two others and this third one is the weakest of the lot although the science seems stronger. There are only five stories in this collection but the book is almost as long as the preceding mad scientist club adventures, therefore the stories are longer and more attention can be paid to details. This helps in the science and also allows more character to be shown. In this respect the book is longer but not so humorous.\nThe first story, \"The Telltale Transmitter\" is somewhat trite to any avowed reader, banks have been robbed by breaking through walls many times in many books, it is just a question of a reader's taste how often he has encountered it. That may be why the science is so simple, it is beginner's science.  As a first read it settles into a deserved niche. \"The second story, the \"Cool Cavern\" seems to me to be written to have the fact that Harman and his group are not trapped in the cave as everyone in town seems to believe, it is written depicting Harman and Sony too unpertirbed to be trapped. Also, the people do not seem to be behaving in accordance with the seeming gravity of the situation, they have their own problems to take care of first. The rainmaker is a little meteorology again, too little trouble is experienced by the club members in making it rain so maybe tdhey are not influencing nature, the author does not make it clear, and the rain stops very conveniently. Then the flying sorceror is wasting money again to no purpose, read it for humor only. The final story lacks science, unless Morse code is science, and why did the boys know shoelaces were use to write code? It is almost like it were planned and not spontaneous. Again, read it for the humor, the book lacks a lot of science and logic,\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

In that light the use of science for the period is excellent except for the dinosaur's egg which is science-less. Also one almost needs to have read \"The Big Kerplop\" first to get the background but then time and events are not correctly sequenced. Still, these are boys' books, to be read for enjoyment and any science picked up is a bonus. Seven stories are related in this book, all are good stories, all seem humorous and the military friendly. The trouble I have, being an adult, is with the money involved in each story, where does it come from and essentially it is wasted. wasted in my terms, not burned or destroyed, but used in a frivolous fashion, not promulgating any benefit to the club, or the town or townspeople, mainly to play tricks. The sea monster is a farce, the big egg is non-scientific, The secret of the old cannon is competitive, but why do the boys figure they have to do it, why not let the town officials and did the reward have any bearing on the action? The unidentified flying man was a good example of a forced wasting of town money to no purpose but funny; and the gas bag race brought in metereology but could the readers follow it? The voice in the chimney was more wasted money, showing the rivalry between two boys' groups, and night rescue was too full of coincidences and a downed pilot completely out of his own rescue. Still I enjoyed it and I am sure mid-teens would get a big kick out of it.

This was a story where there wasn't really a bad guy.  This was a story where the heart took the lead.  You can't help who you fall in love with.

On Sydney's twenty second birthday Ridge tells her that Hunter and Tori her best friend/roommate and boyfriend are having an affair. What does she do ?!?! Where will she go ?!?!

You see the problem is that Ridge has a girlfriend Maggie, and well there is something special about Maggie and regardless of how he feels he will NEVER leave Maggie.\n\n\"Hey, Heart.  Are you listening?  You and I are officially at war.\"\n\nAs they write music together and develop a deep emotional bond, they battle the war within themselves to do what's right and not act on what they feel.

It focuses on a small amount of important and well understood topics and facts and presents them without much detail and without going deep into the science. That does not mean that the book is not informative. So called \"climate skeptics\" are bombarding us with misleading propaganda whilst the media rarely explains much about climate change (or global warming). The result is that the general public is misinformed, know very little about the topic, and know virtually nothing about why we know what we know. This makes every page a potential eye opener to someone who does not know much about the topic.\n\nThe book explains a little about basic greenhouse physics, which goes back 150 years and is not controversial at all. We learn that without greenhouse gases our planet would be 60 degrees cooler and that water vapour and carbon dioxide are the two most important greenhouse gases regulating our planet's temperature. We learn a little bit about Earth's past climate and natural climate cycles and how we can differentiate between natural causes and human causes for climate change. The book also discusses ocean acidification, the usefulness of climate models, and what we can expect in the future. In the last chapter the book explains how politics got into the picture and how it has warped the public's understanding of the topic.\n\nI should say that I believe I understand this topic relatively well (for being a layman). I've read perhaps around a hundred research articles on the topic, dozens of books, and I have a degree in physics. Therefore I did not learn much new from this book. What the book did for me (in a short time) was to highlight the core information about climate change. It helped me organize and summarize my understanding.\n\nHowever, I still think the book was a little too brief in some aspects. The book did not discuss much of the quite compelling evidence we have that the global warming we are observing is human caused and not let say the sun, such as the nature of the warming, that less heat is escaping into space, evidence from spectroscopy, etc. Some debunking of the most typical \"climate skeptic\" arguments could also have been included. I think it would have been nice to have references and suggestions for further reading; books or articles for more serious readers. On the other hand I think the author might have left out that information intentionally to keep it simple, sweet and non-argumentative, so it is still five stars from me. I should add that my edition did not include an afterword. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a basic understanding of climate change. I also recommend the book to people who already know something about the topic but still want a concise and reliable summary.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The book is divided into four parts encompassing in total 60 short chapters. Part I What the science says explains what we know about global warming, what is causing it, and how we know it. Part II Whats actually happening tells us what is happening right now. Part III whats likely to happen in the future is about things we know will happen unless we change course as well as things that might happen if we don't change course. Part IV can we avoid the risks of climate change focuses on ways to mitigate the effects of global warming and ways to avoid it such as geo-engineering.\n\nThe chapters are short and easy to read and overall the book is a laymans introduction to the effects of global warming. However, the author provides a lot of references for those who want to go deeper. The book is very well organized and it can be used as a reference book, almost like an encyclopedia. Just look in the contents for the right chapter. The chapter titles are quite descriptive. Quite often the chapter titles are questions and the chapter content encompasses the answer. The book is also well written and it does not contain any overstatements. It focuses on the established and proven science and in general avoids speculation, unless it explicitly states that it is. This may actually make the book scarier to some people. The known facts and the quite likely scenarios are pretty scary on their own, at least for future generations.\n\nOver the last couple of years I have become increasingly interested in and worried about global warming. Ive studied the science behind it (I have degree in physics) and the evidence that it is happening is very compelling. Yet there is so much science denial and resistance to action in the US. My home country Sweden is handling this much better.

The simple weighted stapler design makes it a breeze to put a million staples in tar paper and feel cool doing it.  Since it is so easy, that also means that people are more likely to do it properly, which makes walking around on the roof safer.  If you are doing a job that requires a lot of stapling, such as siding or roofing, the small investment is worth it, whether you are a professional or a weekend DIYer that may never use it again.\n\nBut, which one should you buy?  I recently purchased the BOSTITCH H30-8, which is similar in price and overall design.  Both are weighted well and designed thoughtfully.  While they are similar, there are a couple small differences.  First, this Tacwise has a little plate around the end to protect tar paper from tearing.  If tar paper isn't laid flat, this can be a problem.  While the plate won't protect you completely, it is a nice feature that I appreciate.\n\nAnother difference is in how staples are loaded.  The BOSTITCH just pops open for quick loading of staples, while the Tacwise requires pressing a button and pulling out a long tray from the handle.  Neither mechanism is an issue, but I do find the BOSTITCH process faster.  More importantly, having the staple tray in the handle makes it bulkier and less ergonomic.\n\nTo be clear, both staplers are excellent tools that I think most people will be happy with.  You may choose one simply based on the price of staples at the time.  However, having both, I prefer to use the BOSTITCH based on the way it is weighted and ergonomics.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It also makes it easier to work alone when working on the side of a building, being able to tack the paper in place with little effort.\n\nA small downside is that, if the tar paper is a bit bulged, the stapler will invariably rip it, whereas the more careful motion of a hand stapler would reveal the bulge before damage is done.  Still, with a bit a caution, this isn't a big deal.\n\nI will update the review if I have issues with durability.

This book would best be classified as being in the \"drama\" genre. There is no action and very little suspense. Instead, this book is a psychological analysis of money and marriage and what can drive a man to consider suicide as the answer to his problems.\n\nThe book alternates between flashing back to the past, and then forward to the present. In the chapters about the past, we learn about how Stacy and Roger, the main characters, meet and fall in love. We learn about Roger's success and Stacy's growing frustration with: 1. Her life as a stay-at-home Mom, despite the fact that she loves her kids so much that she refuses to let a nanny raise them; and 2. Her discomfort with Roger's wealth and his need to display it.\n\nWe learn of Roger's prior history of depression and how he once again starts to spiral into depression when his business starts to tank. Stacy never grew up with much money (and in fact worked with a non-profit helping homeless people, making $19,000 a year) and is able to adapt to the changes the family needs to make as money dries up. Roger, however, feels embarrassed of his personal failure and also feels like he has failed his family and himself. He refuses to talk to Stacy about the family's financial troubles. He is unable to deal with the downgrade in their lifestyle. Things come to a head when the family goes on a vacation to Florida.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book because of the insight it gives into the human psyche where money, or the lack of it, is involved. It shows how financial matters can affect a marriage and the choices people make in (what their mind is) desperate circumstances.\n\nI wish the author spent more time discussing why the pursuit of money, above and beyond what is necessary for a comfortable lifestyle, was so important to Roger. As for Stacy, I would have liked to learn more about when she started becoming disgruntled with her marriage, and why. I feel the author should have spent some more time writing about how Stacy and Roger's marriage went from being idyllic to them turning into virtual strangers living together. The book talks about Stacy and Roger falling in love, as well as the issues they start having after they are married with two kids. I feel that if the author had discussed what their relationship was like after their engagement (it was touched on, but not in depth), but prior into settling into life with two kids, it would've helped to explain the mindset that both Stacy and Roger developed over time.\n\nAll in all, it was an interesting read for anybody who is intrigued by the human psyche.

They are very much in love, as Luke even followed Phoebe from Australia to London to try and win her over. However, the tone of the book changes very quickly, Phoebe and Luke take Tommy out to play. As Luke steps away to buy ice cream for the family, Luke disappears.\n\nAs months pass and Luke is not found, we learn more about Phoebe and Tommy. Phoebe seems resentful of being a full-time Mom. She was an actress in a previous life, doing mostly commercials, but now she is unable to get even commercial work because she is unable to travel for jobs due to a lack of childcare and Luke's judgment of her for leaving her child behind to pursue a career. In the meanwhile, Luke's career flourishes and the focus is all on his success. He neglects to care that his wife is unhappy and struggling as a stay at home Mom. Phoebe turns to the bottle, concerning Luke enough to ask his Mom to stay with them for awhile and help Phoebe out.\n\nAfter Tommy's abduction, Phoebe suffers a mental breakdown. Despite her struggles adjusting to Motherhood, she is crazy about her kid. She will stop at nothing to find him. In the meanwhile, we learn that Luke is not the doting, faithful husband we once thought he was. Phoebe is cast as a bad, unstable mother in the media. However, she will stop at nothing to find her son.\n\nThere were a couple of things I didn't like about this book. Luke is portrayed as loyal and in love with his wife (since childhood, may I add). Yet, there seems to be quite a bit of sleeping around and infidelity on his part. Also, the ending was pretty predictable. I was able to figure out very early on who had taken Tommy.\n\nThis book is worth your read if you have some time to kill. However, the fickleness of the character's personalities may be a turn off for some people, as it was for me.\nScore:"}], "output": "3", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.62}, {"id": "21651", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nDidn't understand half of the book but enjoyed all of it.\n\nFalkner delves into the hacking underworld with the precision of a surgeon and the expertise of an engineer.

Sometimes, I was just hanging on to a runaway train.\n\nI was halfway through the book when I realized one salient point: HE DID THIS IN 1984!\n\nThe internet, according to some, wasn't publicly available until the late 80s.

Standard Tarot deck packaging, plastic wrapped cardboard flip top box, cards inside also plastic wrapped, standard LWB. Box is 2 11/16\" by 4 13/16\", cards measure 2 5/8\" by 4 3/4\".  Deck has standard tarot's 78 cards with a couple extra cards, a front title card of a cool cat floating Buddha style over a sunflower (a different version of the Magician) and the Tarot Illuminati's High Priestess on the back of that same card.  The last or 80th card advertises three other decks by Lo Scarabeo.  Backs of cards are reversible, showing mirror reflections of a black cat's head wearing a tiara, with dark blue and grey swirly designs around the heads.  (some of which are 3 lobed and look vaguely like a Micky Mouse silhouette, but maybe that's just my imagination).  Cards follow the Rider Waite style, with the four suites being Chalices, Pentacles, Wands, and Swords. There is a spread using six cards, called \"the cat's tail\" in the LWB.  The LWB instructions are in English thru page 12, Italian, Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese, but the cards are merely numbered, the Major Arcana in Roman numerals, and the suite cards numbered 1-10, then has symbols for Page being a helmet, Knight, (horses head), Queen (crown) and King (orb with three lobed cross).  Minor Arcana has numbers or court symbols at the top, with suite symbols (cup, wand, sword, or coins) at the bottom.  Majors have the Roman numerals at both top and bottom, all in a thin black border that has grey flowery things in the corners.  These cards are cute, and follow loosely the standard Rider Waite meanings or images with cats, of course.  I kindof hoped the Queen of Wands would have had a tiny scruffy humanoid figure at the foot of her throne, but no, she's on her knees in a garden feeding little birdies. Strength is VIII, Justice is XI, and all of the Majors have standard Rider-Waite labels.  Cards are very nice, slippery and thin without being plastic-y, easy to shuffle.  Some cards I think worth mentioning or contrasting:\nThe Fool, a cute little white kitty, who goes thru his journey as a black kitty, then at The World, sheds his black kitty suit and turns back into a white kitty.  The Heirophant, representing Spiritual Authority, is sitting on a tree stump handing out cheese to mice, holding the Golden Key of Knowledge.  The Five of Chalices, a black kitty sitting in the snow, with her head in hands-interesting because in the Rider Waite Smith cards, the only card depicting snow is the 5 of Pentacles.  The 5 of Pentacles in the Black Cats depicts a couple kittys in a cave sharing the last of a bony fish, then in the 6 of Pentacles, these two are being helped out of the cave by another cat with gold jewels on.  The 9 of Pentacles has a hunk of cheese on a stump being nibbled on by a white rat, with kitties hiding in the bushes, watching...waiting to ambush?\n\nAll in all, I am pretty happy with these cards, but I think I will probably keep them as collector cards and use my ole standby RWS cards for readings.\n\nHope this helps you make a choice!  These are cute, and could be used for readings for children or others who are disturbed by nudity or other images-the raciest thing here is the Lovers waltzing up the Stairway to Heaven!\n\nThe Black Cat Satin Tarot Bag by Lo Scarabeo<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Black-Cat-Satin-Tarot-Bag/dp/073873506X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Cat Satin Tarot Bag</a>&nbsp;is the perfect bag to put these cards in, too!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Certainly not from Greek conductor Teodor Currentzis who admirably managed to get SONY to record in studio the Da Ponte trilogy, something that not even William Christie got in Harmonia Mundi and then in ERATO.\nOf course recording in Perm, in the middle of the Urals must have helped, it must be very cheap to record there. From the booklet one can see that all the strings are Russian and the winds from Western Europe, the orchestra is very good.\nCurrentzis like in the previously issued Le Nozze di Figaro, got several weeks of rehearsal to polish every little detail, probably not since the times of Walter Legge and John Culshaw, a studio recording got these many rehearsals. The time was well spent, everybody seems on his toes, unusually but quite correctly Currentzis allows some appoggiaturas [not written decorations in the arias usually improvised by the singers]. There is unanimity of purpose from all and it is a very fine performance, so where does it stand?\nDifficult to say, the competition is tremendous. Among HIP versions I like better the superb Ren Jacobs, it's as well rehearsed and prepared and his singers are in general better, and in the case of the Fiordiligi much better. Simone Kermes for Curretzis is an acquired taste: the voice is thin and somewhat characterless, the role lies low for her, she manages the low notes as whispers, but I feel this wouldn't work in the theater. Fortunately she sings the role straight, without her usual eccentricities, but hell, there are so many divine Fiordiligis [Lisa della Casa, Lella Cuberli, Margaret Price, Leontyne Price, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, Gundula Janowitz, Kiri Te Kanawa, Montserrat Caball and yes, Vronique Gens for Jacobs] that one has to say that La Kermes just doesn't belong to their ranks. The Dorabella is much more pleasing, Malena Ernman is a singer to watch, the voice is attractive, and she tries to be lively, but she too can't erase memories of goddesses like Teresa Berganza, Frederica von Stade, Christa Ludwig or Tatiana Troyanos, but in her own terms she does well. The Despina is even better, Anna Kasyan sings well as is very funny, an enjoyable performance. Tenor Kenneth Tarver also sings well but lacks personality, especially when compared with super star tenors like Leopold Simoneau, Alfredo Kraus, Luigi Alva, Francisco Araiza and Hans-Peter Blochwitz. The role of Ferrando is fiendishly difficult, in the XIX Century no less than Rubini had it in his repertoire, now tenors seem more capable of solving the technical difficulties, and Tarver sounds very comfortable indeed, but a more positive and memorable personality is missing. The Don Alfonso, Konstantin Wolff, is another competent but slightly unmemorable performer. You just have to hear a Sesto Bruscantini or a Gabriel Bacquier to see how much more you can get from the role. And last but not least, Christopher Maltman as Guglielmo gives the one performance I liked a lot: virile, elegant, stylish and engaging, very fine indeed.\nI was all the more disappointed that Guglielmo's discarded aria \"Rivolgete a lui lo sguardo\" was not included. Now many recordings have it, and since it's inexpensive to record in Perm, there's no excuse for omitting it.\nSo, not a first choice in spite of a good recording because of the mighty competition.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

At least she left a handful of opera recordings very much worth collecting:  Aida, Trovatore, Don Carlo and this Luisa Miller. Unfortunately she never  recorded Ballo and Forza, she would have been wonderful as Amelia and  Leonora di Vargas. In this recording of Luisa Miller her voice can be heard  at its best, true spinto singing in the mold of Zinka Milanov. She has  strong support from that fine baritone Vladimir Chernov, who sadly has also  been having vocal difficulties lately. Both are very moving as father and  daughter, and it's wonderful to hear two real Verdi voices together.  Placido Domingo in his second recording as Rodolfo is still in fresh voice  and totally involved. Is this the best Luisa Miller? Well no, there are 2  other recordings at least as good: the  DG Maazel with Ricciarelli, Domingo  and Bruson, and the DECCA Maag with Pavarotti, Caballe and Milnes. Katia  Ricciarelli was very special as Luisa, probably her finest recording ever,  and the great Renato Bruson was incomparable as Miller, if forced to  choose, this will be my favourite recording. The Pavarotti/Caballe is  marvelous too, especially for Caballe in one of her finest recordings, the  voice itself unbelievably beautiful, if not as touching as Ricciarelli.

Violet Blaze is a new author for me and that only sweetened the deal more. Yet as I got into Raw and Dirty I found that while the story itself is good there were parts didn't like as a reader.\n\nThe Good:\n\nRoyal.  Holy f-ing crap this man is sexy as sin. Every time he talked I could hear that English accent in my head and my panties would start to incinerate. You can feel the sexual tension oozes off every page when hes in a room with Lyric.  If I could lick a book and taste a character, he would be the one I would want the first lick off of.  Hes a complicated man who does what is necessary for his club.  Hes an all or nothing kind of guy who takes what he wants when he wants it.\n\nThe Meh:\n\nI just couldn't connect with Lyric. She goes from being the prim and proper daughter of the mayor to a dirty biker chick in under 60 seconds flat.  Granted, if Royal looked at me the way he was looking at her, I might take a difference stance on it.  Her story line was so damn predictable and I hated that the author took enough care to talk about how easily the woman she replaced fell into Royals bed and how she wouldnt end up like her.  I called BS from the beginning.  There should have been more of a resistance on her part instead of just throwing open her legs and inviting him in for dessert.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe ending.  I saw right off the bat that the author specifically stated that this wouldnt end in a cliff hanger, but it sort of does.  Youre reading along and just when you think that things are going to settle into place. BAM! The book ends.  While there isn't a cliff hanger per say, the way the author finished the first book is less than desirable.  I know that their story is likely to continue in the next book, but the transition could have been executed so much better.\n\nAll in all Raw and Dirty does live up to its name, but I had some ups and downs as I read it.  Think with a bit of tweaking that this book could easily become a 5 Star read.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

While each book followed a different set of characters, I knew that in the end they would intersect in some way, shape or form. Brightmores tales are dark and twisted, but its the romance portion of the story that I struggle with.  Each character seems to almost fall instantly in love with the male or female counterpart to the story. To me, there isn't enough build up or interaction between Aubrey and West for readers to really get a taste for their relationship.  Sure, they interact at the library and there are hints that this has been going on for quite some time, but readers aren't privy to that off page context so there isn't ample enough time to build a connection.\n\nWhile the romance fizzled a bit for me, the sex scenes sizzle.  Brightmore knows how to turn the passionate heat up between her characters and trust me ladies, this one is a five alarm fire. The dark and twisted portions of the story and the series combined are spot on.  You feel the intense emotions and dark intentions of these perpetrators and the painful writhing of the victims.  Having a background in law enforcement and forensics, there are some minor issues with how the crime scenes are investigated that bug me, but to someone who doesnt have a background in those areas, that wouldnt be an issue and likely overlooked.\n\nDenouement has its high and lows that honestly may just be due to my personal preferences or my background.  While this book may not have been my cup of tea, Im sure there are plenty of people out there that will enjoy the novel.  I understand the blood, sweat, and tears that authors put into writing their books and Im not one of those kinds of readers who will mark down every single little thing I didn't like or didn't agree with to nit-pick. Instead, I am just going encourage those who like twisted, dark romances to give this book and series a shot.  Every reader is different and its those differences that make books so magical so don't base your judgment on what one person has to say about a book.

I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.\n\nSometimes we can hear the story of Christ so many times, that we loose sight on how it can change our lives and change our every day. This is a great study for believers and non believers alike to take that journey and to see first hand what the life and death of Christ means to you and to me. The why helps us take that truth and make it our very own. What we begin to see is that we are nothing like Jesus and even on our best days. We don't love, we don't forgive, we don't trust and obey. In our self-centeredness, we become destructive to ourselves and those around us.\n\nEach chapter starts with a verse starting with the betrayal of Judas and goes to show us how we relate to the circumstances in the verse. It ends with a hymn to lead the reader into worship of our great salvation in Christ.\n\nWe see between Peter and Judas the denial of Christ and the response of each man. We all have denied Christ, and our response is one of Peter or one of Judas. We also begin to understand with that response, the reason why we follow Jesus. In hard times, our response to him becomes the fruit that the world sees. We become the taste to see if the Lord is good. In Peter, his repetance leads to salvation and a transformed life. Judas was a remorse but not Godly and it lead to his death. It does not become a question if we have done wrong, but where do we go from there. One of my favorite verses is the one when Jesus asked his disciples if they would leave him and they replied, where would we go.\n\nAnother great chapter was that on Pontus Pilate and his response to Christ. We are shown by Jesus' response to Pilate that God's kingdom is not of this world. That political parties will not save and restore the people but Christ alone will. This kingdom will come from the cross.\n\nAs you read and marvel at the goodness of God and the work of Christ, you will begin to see how we are like each one in the passover week. From Judas, to Pilate, to the theives on the cross, Barabbas that was freed, to Simon carrying the cross. We also learn that we have been given the holy spirit to enable us to see if we are someone that is wronged or someone who needs forgiveness.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Why have you forsaken me? Where o death, is your victory? Why do you seek the living among the dead? Do you not know these things.\n\nEach of these questions are rich and each question is answered fully in a chapter that engage you to thinking more deeply about Jesus.\n\nI find it interesting how Jesus asked John Do you love me three times and Jesus is asking his Father three times - Is there another way? Because it is a spiritual war taking place, a war between a holy God who hates sin and a unholy humanity that hates God and the hosility that is a result of that, the question is there any other way is more for us to know. Do you feel the tension between the world and God..it is for us know that there is no other way for justice to come. Jesus who is without sin, being fully man and God took our place to demonstrate His rigtheousness that He might be just and show mercy on us sinners. The cross shows the wrath of God and His mercy for us which leads us to the next question. Why have you forsaken me? Why did Jesus have to be forsaken by the Father? Was the abandonment of Jesus the greatest of his suffering. What does that mean for me and for you.\n\nAnother great question, do you actively live with the death of Christ in view or the resurrection in view and what does that look like. The resurrection adds triumph to the tragedy. Life lived in light of the resurrection includes radical sacrifices in faith. That statement is profound to me. That is thinking deeply of the faith we have in our risen Lord. What happens if we are not living in light of the resurrection, we seek the living among the dead. Our lives have purpose in light of the resurrection. And lastly, when we know these things and remember, we see God's providence.\n\nI really enjoyed this book and what I learned. There is much to be captivated and be in awe of the death and resurrection of Christ.

The speed is a definite improvement over our previous router, an Apple Airport Extreme. I stream music via my iPhone over wifi, and with the new router, the process of opening the streaming site, selecting the music, and starting the stream went from sluggish to nearly instantaneous. I also play XBox games, and this router eliminated the annoying stutter and lag in the gameplay. The old Airport network, even with an Airport Express extending the network to a point right next to the Xbox, did not get good results when I ran an Xbox test for Multiplayer Connection. The ACS5400, although a floor away, got a passing grade from the Xbox diagnostic, and it seems a lot snappier.\n\nThis router, as promised, really is lightning fast. The signal easily penetrates the floor and ceiling to reach all the floors of our old house. And for the first time, based on measurements on a speed testing website, we are finally meeting and even exceeding the promised upload and download speeds from our ISP!\n\nNow for the technical details on this baby. Installation is as straightforward as it gets. You simply start your modem, connect the router to it, and turn it on. Configuration is comparable to Apples Airport in simplicity. You can configure the router via an Ethernet cable, or by a wireless connection, using the default password on the bottom of the device. (You may want to write this password down or photograph the bottom of the router before you install it, so you can more easily access this info.) Whatever you do, make sure that as soon as you get in, you change the password to something secure.\n\nThe administration software is web-browser based, and its a lot less technically challenging than routers Ive installed several years ago. It has a very basic interface that allows you to easily set up 3 separate wireless networks, plus a guest network that gives you control over what users see on your network. And of course, it also has 4 wired Ethernet ports so you can directly plug in nearby printers and computers.\n\nThere is a very handy parental control feature that allows you to limit access to websites for specific devices on the network, so you can put google or youtube\" on your blacklist, and any URL with that phrase in it will not load on your kids iPhone. Alternatively, you can have a whitelist, where you specify a list of safe sites you want a younger child to be able to see.\n\nMy one disappointment, and this is Apples fault, is that the Airport Extreme and Express cannot join or extend the TP-Links wireless network. The only way I can still use the Apple equipment at all is to plug the Extreme into one of the wired Ethernet ports of the ACS5400, from which it can share that connection with the Airport Express satellites. So if you need something that Apple routers will talk to wirelessly, you should be aware of this limitation.\n\nOverall, apart from that little glitch, this is a much bigger improvement to the overall performance of our network than I had expected. Highly recommended.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Aside from improving network strength, it also replaces my old Internet modem, which reduces clutter and wires and power consumption under my desk.\n\nRunning Google, Ookla, and Speakeasy speed tests, I get readings of a consistent 9-10 Mbps for upload, twice the speed of my former modem, and between 78 and 134 Mbps download. If you're not in a major metroplis, you would likely get a more consistent reading. But I am very satisfied with speed and consistency when I stream from Amazon and Hulu, use GoToMyPC remote computing, and stream music pretty much all day.\n\nThe speed tests were run while the router was supporting 10 wireless clients and 9 wired clients, including iPhones, printers, a smart TV, 2 Rokus, a doorbell camera, and an Airport Extreme router (which in turn extended the network to 3 Airport Express repeaters), although possibly not all of them were actively using Internet at the time.\n\nThe control panel is accessed by a browser, and has more settings than I even feel comfortable messing with. But fortunately, there is a Basic panel and an Advanced panel. You can set up several separate networks using both 2.4 and 5 GHz. You can set up guest networks with separate passwords and privileges, so if you have tenants or run an AirBnB, you can give others Internet access without sharing your private server.\n\nThis modem router has firewall settings and system tools galore. And if you know what you're doing, you can set up things like port forwarding, so you can run a Minecraft server from your home.\n\nBottom line, this is a fast, powerful, and stable modem router suitable for both non-techies and advanced network admins.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.65}, {"id": "21682", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nOh, I have to have ALL of Mitch Albom's books....Great, no Perfect Books.

Nicodemus ( Nick) is the half brother of Demetrius, one of the current Argonauts who guards the city of Argolea.  Nick was sent to the human world as a child, cast out, to survive on his own, while Demetrius was raised by his father, to take his father's place as an Argonaut when he came of age.  But what no one really understood was why one brother stayed and the other was banished.  Because the Argolean high council was afraid of Nick.  He was a true Hero.  He is the son of Kronos, king of the Titans and father of Zeus, and Atalanta, one of the original Argonauts.\n\nNick has traded himself for the soul of Isadora, queen of Argolea.  He is now in the hands of Zagreus, Hades son.  The goal: break him, and make the dark energy that Kronos' paternity gave him come forth, thus allowing Hades to become more powerful.\n\nCynna is working for Zagreus, as his chief torturer.  But she sees something in Nick that makes her want to help him.  Together they escape, but are they truly safe from the prying eyes of Hades and Zagreus?\n\nThis is the 7th book in the Eternal Guardians series.  There is an underlying plot that was established in book one, and is following through each sequential book afterward.  The books are set in a dual parallel universe; here and Argolea.  The books go back and forth from one area to another.  They are full of mythological references, and larger than life heroes.  Followers of Greek Mythology will understand many of the references in these books, while those who are looking for an adventurous trek through sword and sorcery will like this too.  I would recommend that you read all the books, in order for the best understanding of the ongoing plot.  HOWEVER, there is enough backstory given in each book that you can read them alone.  But, readers beware, I think that if you pick this book up, without having read the other ones, you will go back to read them all. There are enough references that will pique your interest, to learn about the rest of the descendants of the original Argonauts, and the stories that they have to tell\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The A6300 is an incredibly powerful piece of kit that, beneath it's very easy to use \"auto\" modes, has a plethora of often extremely useful shooting options that require explanation to understand. It also has one of the most complicated & opaque on-board menu systems I've come across and an instruction manual that's close to useless. Gary Friedman's excellent book is, in essence, a detailed and very clear user guide that carefully walks you through every menu option while explaining what it does and why you may (or may not) wish to use it - by the end of it you'll feel that you're in control of your A6300 rather than the other way round.\n\nSecond, if you're intending to use your A6300 for regular video shooting, to reprogram button \"C1\" that sits next to the shutter release as the video on/off button and to then set the camera up so that this button only works when the camera is in \"Movie\" mode - within a short time of trying to use the camera in its \"out of the box\" configuration you'll understand why these two changes will make shooting video so much easier. Trying to explain how to do this using Sony's labyrinthian menu system would take too long, which, of course, is why you need a guide book like Gary Friedman's.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.24}, {"id": "21696", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis is a great product.

The story is written from the point of view of Aimee, a young bride-to-be who quickly - and mysteriously - becomes a widow, burying her fianc on the day they were supposed to walk down the aisle. After a supposed psychic shows up at the funeral and tells Aimee her fianc is still alive, Aimee can't shake the feeling that something is not right.\n\nIt took a little while for this book to build momentum, so it took me longer than it usually would for me to read it. The first few pages were interesting enough to draw me into the book; we are quickly introduced to Aimee, the family of her deceased fianc, James, and the bizarre psychic who upends her world. After that, the narrative comes to a crawl. While the process of Aimee's grieving and the life that she begins the build from the ashes of her engagement are essential to the story and the character, it felt like some things were given a little too much attention and others not enough. For example, the process of her finding a place for her restaurant and many of the scenes with her parents early on seem drawn out and largely unnecessary, especially since the part her parents play in the book as it continues is nominal. However, events like her growing friendship and interest in sexy photographer and new found probably-more-than-a-friend Ian are strangely underplayed, losing nuances that would have further fleshed out events that occur later in the narrative.\n\nThat said, I will give Lonsdale credit where credit is due. Had this been any other book, I would have stopped reading before I was done with the first half of the book. This story, however, I kept coming back to, because the author definitely did one thing that all mystery writers need to do; she made me want to find out what the heck was going on.\n\nEven through the slower first part of the book, we are given fascinating glimpses and moments that help fuel the story in promising ways. Whenever I started to feel a little bored, I would hit an interesting moment that ignited Aimee's doubt and curiosity as well as mine. The further I got into the book, the more interested I became. Who is this psychic? What happened to James' missing paintings? Why does Aimee get so upset around his odd cousin? Lonsdale also uses flashbacks to help flesh out Aimee and James' backstory, and she does it well. I have often seen flashbacks used in ways that failed in enhancing a story correctly, but Lonsdale managed to pick and choose moments that not only give us background on the characters but also carry an odd, sinister feeling that left me unsettled. As the narrative progresses, these seemingly unrelated events start to paint the background of this story's complicated and startling image.\n\nWhile the first half of the book took some time for me to get through, I read the second half in one sitting. I often write reviews including spoilers, but I am deliberately not for this one because it was so surprising and complex that I would hope anyone reading it will be able to enjoy it for themselves. In a lot of ways, I kind of wish the author had spent more of the book on Part Two, as I would have loved to have seen Aimee have more time to progress with the truths she discovers and the choices that she makes along the way. I also feel like Lonsdale hit a stride with Part Two, explaining the setting in such a vivid way that I felt like I was there in a much more real way than the setting of Part One. If found myself proclaiming \"What the heck!\" a number of times as new information was disclosed, excited to find out what was really going on. The book ends with an opening for a sequel that is due out July of this year. Usually, I am not a fan of books (or movies) that set up sequels, but I think it was inevitable and a good choice of the author in this case. While the book itself can stand alone, the characters and events are dynamic enough to warrant a sequel that will probably offer new insights and mysteries.\n\nEverything We Keep is a novel that is, flaws included, an honest and genuine narrative. It successfully defies genre conventions as it manages to be chick-lit, drama, romance, and mystery all at the same time. The beautiful title sums up the realities of the book; it's about the memories, mementos, secrets, and struggles that we sometimes hold onto for far too long. But it's also about how losing the things that once defined us can lead us to who we're meant to be.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

As a Solitary Witch, I have fallen a bit out of my practice and was looking for something intriguing and structured in order to help me back onto the path. Buckland's book is written for those new to the Craft, those who wish to further their knowledge and also those who just are interested in the history of Wicca. Each chapter is followed by a lesson where you are asked to answer questions ranging from personal introspection to facts discussed in the lesson, adding an interactive quality to the book that makes it much more dynamic and interesting. I'm already in love with this book and I can't wait to read the rest of it! Keep in mind, however, that Buckland is coming from a more structured environment, so witches and Wiccans of the eclectic variety might find his teachings a big too stringent. If you are looking for a good baseline for knowledge and education to build your own practice from, however, or if you are looking for a more structured and traditional practice, this is definitely a fantastic starting point for all those drawn to the Craft, whether it be spiritual or academic.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.13}, {"id": "21698", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nEasy one-handed finger press opens, from the side, not from inside, even faster with a flick of the wrist while pressing on the metal piece on the side, 2.5 inches makes it more legal in certain cities, always check the laws, I measured it, it was exact, compact, pocket size, dark black, has belt clip.

He is super star and doesn't trust a woman, because he has broken heart. Could they trust each other?\nWill both of them change and find happiness together?\n\nAnother amazing book from Aven Ellis. This book is from Dallas Demons series, first one was about Kylie and Harrison, they appear in this book too. Harrison is hockey player too in Dallas Demons and he is married with Kylie. I find everything that I expect from one great romance book the plot is very descriptive and real, there two people who will fall in love and there are romantic moments that I want to read. The \"game\" hot-cold in the beginning between Kenley and Nate makes me want to read till the end.\n\nKenley is independent woman. She couldn't accept that people in her see beautiful, blond woman, she is more then that, she is smart and intelligent too. Kenley intends to show how she is beautiful inside making chocolate in amazing shapes and with amazing flavors. She is so successful in that. Her heart is open for all chocolates in the world, but is close for man.\n\nNate is traded in Dallas Demons from Minnesota. There in Minnesota he experiences betrayal in the worst way and he loses confidence in women. He is super star and wanted by women, but he is broken and disappointed. Nate could be with any woman that he will wants to be, but he doesn't want.\n\nFrom all characters I like Kenley's mother. She is so funny I laugh till tears on her gaffes. She is middle age woman who want to surf on internet and find all stories about celebrities and believes in all.\n\nThis book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

She desperate needs to tell her secret to Bridget and to ask her for help with that column. But when she get home something went wrong.\nI was captivated by the title of this book, its so intriguing. But I must tell you that there in the book its very little of that sex column stuff. I was expected that the author will be concentrate on that with the column, how Skyler manage to write it and from where she get help, but that is just mentioned by the way not elaborated. The authors attention is to describe how Skyler manage to live with her unfulfilled love and how she lives with her big secret. Its not bad at all. The story keeps me reading, which is expected because I was curious to find what Skyler will do, how she will survived after revealing the secret and how her love life will be in the end.\nSkyler is great girl in her twenties and somehow she is virgin. She keeps that in secret, but when she spokes that loud that become a mistake. She gets on my nerves with that Ollie stuff: Ollie this, Ollie that. She has that great opportunity to finds love, she doesnt grub it, but in the end everything goes like suppose to be.\nBridget is funny girl, she doesnt thing just react and that gives to the situation funny end. She is friend that everyone supposes to have.\nBridgets brother Oliver is careless man. I start to like him right the way he shows up in the book. I don't like the things how it seems that are, but there deep in the book I realized why he does, what he does.\nI recommend this book to everyone who loves light and funny, romantic books.\nThis book was bought from Amazon.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.48}, {"id": "21712", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI am in f*****g love with Blaise Richards!!!!!!

I read Beautifully Damaged the Indie version months ago and fell in love with it. So when I found out that Lucien's story was coming out I was beyond excited because I really liked his character. Although, I do love Lucien now that I got to read his full story it's the delivery of the book I was a little disappointed with.\n\nI know every author has their way of writing a book and in no way am I telling anyone how they should write but I am entitled to my opinion. For me, this book had too much going on. I mean Trace and Ember had their story told in Beautifully Damaged so I think this book should of just focused on Lucien and Darcy. The multiple POV's which were not in first person is a little hiccup for me. I'm not a fan of third person reads especially if there is going to more than one character to follow.\n\nIt's all connected, I know, it's what connects the characters and brings the story to life but it was a little much for me. I liked the book, yes, a lot (I know that probably doesn't make sense but I really did). After getting over my little pet peeves and quirks I loved Lucien and Darcy's journey. It was emotional, heartbreaking and the passion and chemistry between them was beautiful. It was such an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nThis book is filled with love, suspense, heartache, twists and turns you will not be expecting. What I really do love about this book is that L.A. Fiore was able to draw me in emotionally and that's a biggie for me when reading. I want to feel the emotions the characters are experiencing. When they are hurting, I want to feel their pain. When they are sad and heartbroken, I want to cry along with them. When they are happy and content, I want to be smiling too. And she totally did that. That's what got me, that pull you feel when reading is what made me look past the little stuff and really love this book.\n\nDo I recommend reading this book? Yes, absolutely. It truly is a great read of raw emotion, heartache and second chances. I'm just a little picky especially considering the first book in the serious was absolutely amazing but this one was just written differently. However, I did enjoy the story line and fell more in love with Lucien. So yes, if you haven't read it add it to the list.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.92}, {"id": "21713", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI had picked up this book specifically because it had time travel involved and I'm a time travel nut.  In this particular book, the main character, Connie, \"travels\" to the future, the year 2137 supposedly.  Of course, since she is in a mental institution, there is a bit of the theme: Is she crazy or is it real?  The writing was well done, the character development was fantastic.  The time travel was left wanting.  This is a great drama story, a good woven tale.  I feel a bit jilted as the author left the ending too open ended, as if just to create a forever left argument over her schizophrenia or time travel.  That felt a bit too contrived.

The kind of books that make you want to read the words out loud because it isn't enough to just see it. I want to hear it too.\n\nI believe it is the quaint, quiet of the story that I loved so much. Eowyn paints a picture of a lonely husband and wife (Jack and Mabel) who move to Alaska after losing their child at birth. They hope to start a new life in the quiet plains of a frigid, sprawling homestead. Like most husbands and wives they are each dealing with their own loss and pain but not turning to each other for comfort. The loss of the baby is like a white\n\nelephant in the room. Each sidestepping and avoiding but wishing the other understood them.\n\nTo help with the finances Mabel bakes pie for a hotel restaurant in town once a week and looks forward to baking. It gives her pride to help her husband but when the restaurant doesn't need her anymore, Jack considers joining the mine crew. He meets George, a farmer who offers to visit with his family (wife, Evelyn and boys) to help Jack get the fields plowed for seeding.\n\nEvelyn is a complete contrast to stiff and rigid Mabel. She is loud, cusses, shoots a gun and helps the boys as needed. I enjoyed the conversations with these two very different woman.\n\nRejuvenated by their new friends, Mabel and Jack smile more and one snowy evening, they create a snowman. When they are done, they realize it is very small, \"only up to Jack's waistband.\" They decide to make it a little girl complete with a snow skirt and they give her berry stained lips after Jack carves out a delicate face. They dress it with mittens and a scarf and head indoors, lying together after making love, they fall asleep.\n\nThe next morning the snowchild is gone but they occasionally see a flash of color running through the trees. Tracks of a child and a fox are spotted. Jack and Mabel eventually convince the child to come indoors and thus begins a quiet, relationship between the child and the adults. An understanding of their precious time together. She disappears when Spring comes and gets overheated when she isn't outside. She grows up in front of their eyes eventually falling in love with one of Evelyn and George's boys named Garrett.\n\nWithout giving too much away, this is an interesting book that will have you scratching your head and wondering if magic and love is what brought her to life! \"That night the child was born to them of ice and snow and longing.\"\n\nMy favorite quotes:\n\n\"What happened in that cold dark, when frost formed a halo in the child's straw hair and snowflake turned to flesh and bone? The exact science of one molecule transformed into another Mablre could not explain, but then again, she couldn't explain how a fetus formed in the womb, how cells became a beating heart and hoping soul.\"\n\n\"She had watched other woman with infants and eventually understood what she craved: the boundless permission - no, the absolute necessity - to hold and kiss and stroke this tiny person. Cradling a swaddled infant in their arms, mothers would distractedly touch their lips to their babies' foreheads. Passing their toddlers, mothers would tousle their hair or even sweep them up in their arms and kiss them hard along their chins and necks until the children squealed with glee. Where else in life, Mabel wondered, could a woman love so openly and with such abandon?\"\n\nThis is truly a beautiful book written with imagination and the obvious love of a mother.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Telling us the story as she would tell her children. I can't imagine that anyone else would have been right for Steve in his lifetime. Terri and Steve had a connection that was built on respect, love and a mutual desire to make this world a better place for the animals on our planet. They were obviously soul mates from the moment they met and I really respect Terri and the strength she shows everyday in keeping up the Australia Zoo and following through with Steve's dreams for the future.\nMaybe it is because I actually loved Steve, maybe it because of the passion and enthusiasm he exhibited every time you heard him speak about animals, or maybe it is because I am an incurable romantic who hopes that that everyone could have a love like Terri and Steve. Perhaps it is all that and more or none of it. What I do know, is that this is a fantastic book, well worth reading. If we didn't already know what a special individual Steve Irwin is, Terri shows us why. She honors him on every page and I can only hope that she put out another book when she has had more time to heal. There must be tons more stories about the man who left this world as a legend.\nIt is impossible to imagine how she managed that first moment when she heard that her soul mate was gone.

The brush is comes with is useless for this precipitate. Has anyone found an effective way to remove this deposit. It is not simple scale, is is very resistant to acid and the  only way I have found to remove it is to put a soft wire through each hole.

Wish I could buy it somewhere else. If I had a chance to get my money back, I would not buy this model, I would have purchased the nice juice press instead.\norginal review:\nI have been using this everyday since it arrived about Christmas time. OK, I have another juicer, an older heavy juiceman. It still works ok for a centrifical juicer. But with green leafy stuff, it is not very good at all. SO.. I run everything care free through the juiceman, and then put all the wet pulp from that into my Angel. I get almost the same amount of juice again. It works much better this way because the feeder chute on the Angel is small, and the juiceman is about 2.5 inches. MY favorite juice is cellery, carrot, apple, a tiny bit of ginger, a half of lemon(half peeled), and kale or red chard, and beets. I love this stuff and can feel my vibrance and health increase as I swallow. Just wonderful. If you do not juice, you are really missing out on so many things those micro nutrients can do for your mind and body. Cheers!\nUpdate 6/12/12: I have been using the superangel 5500 for 6 months now and the screen is plugged up with a brown hard mineral deposit, probably some polyphenols, because of the amounts of chard and beets I juice. I have soaked it in vinagar, lemon juice, scrubbed with brushes. this stuff is very hard and will not come off. 80% of the pores are pugged in some of the areas. The brush is comes with is useless for this precipitate. Has anyone found an effective way to remove this deposit. It is not simple scale, is is very resistant to acid and the  only way I have found to remove it is to put a soft wire through each hole.

I think this is the best book by this author I've read yet... the depth of the characters, the pacing of the plot, and the mystery itself were just perfect.\n\nI just so completely love Elliot and Tucker and the way their relationship has evolved over the three books, well no one does that better than Josh Lanyon. While everything is told from Elliot's point of view and his perspective of what Tucker is feeling and thinking, we get to know Tucker in such an interesting way. From the cold, hurt ex-lover in Fair Game who was misunderstood, and as they begin their tenuous reunion. Then in Fair Play and we see more of Tucker's devotion to Elliot, but Elliot is struggling with his loss of power (between his injury and not being an agent any more) plus his need for submission in the bedroom and trusting Tucker with this side of his personality. Tucker is trying so hard to be what Elliot needs, it just broke my heart to go through that with Elliot.\n\nI can't even begin to talk about the development in their relationship in this book without massive spoilers, so I think I'll wait 'till the release date and update this review about that then.\n\nNow, the mystery! Holyhotdamn - do not expect to put this book down once you start it, the twists and turns and the way it all comes back together were 100% perfectly done. Hands down the best mystery Josh Lanyon has written yet. I was cursing the author several times, \"How could you do this to me!!\" Seriously fantastic.\n\nThroughout the book I was continually hit by the beauty of the prose (I couldn't help myself and I highlighted a bunch of the ones that really blew me away). This author's writing is always wonderfully descriptive but it just struck me over and over again in this book, it was simply a pleasure to read it.\n\nI understand this is supposed to be the final book in this series but I hope we'll get some codas - especially if they are from Tucker's pov.

The author might have been onto something at the beginning, but needed to make the tale much shorter or considerably longer to be effective. The story is also saddled with gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence, and gratuitous violent sex. And that's before you get to the really icky part.\n\nThe mystery at the heart of the tale is an interesting proposition: a child goes missing when left alone by her single father for a few minutes, even though the car in which she's sleeping is under the watchful eye of a truck stop waitress. Unknown to her dad, this truck stop has been the hunting grounds of a serial killer for many years. He can be forgiven, since he's not from the area and is just passing through. The niggling thought that popped up within the first few pages for me, however, was \"what's the excuse for local law enforcement and those who work daily at the site?\"\n\nHad the author included just the core cast of characters working at this location, he might have been able to create some depth for them. Instead, he brings in a whole cadre of minor characters, all of whom raise troubling questions without adding anything to the story. Rather than staying invested in the missing child, all I could wonder was why is that one driver so cranky? Who is in the photo another driver keeps looking at? Whose feet *were* in those baby socks? Seriously, what's the deal with that mother/son trucking team? Was this the cop's first day on the job, or was he just abysmally stupid? And exactly how many people have to go missing from the same truck stop before someone raises an eyebrow and wonders out loud if there's something fishy going on?\n\nOne star for what started out as a promising premise left unfulfilled, and another for an interesting (though no more well thought out than everything else) ending.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Count me among their number.\n\nKillough-Walden has done an excellent job in updating both the story and the characters we came to know in the original tale of Peter Pan. Though she took some poetic license with the setting and timing (this story is described as taking place five years after the Darling children's return from Neverland, but is obviously set in modern times), it adds rather than detracts from HKW's story. I was pleased that she didn't try to write her book as a sequel to the original, but created an original of her own.\n\nWhat's to like: The updated characters. The realistic portrayal of parents trying to navigate their new and unexpected reality of dealing with what they assume to be the mental breakdown of at least one of their children. The kids themselves struggling to balance that which they know and all its implications with the \"normalcy\" the adults in their lives wish for them to find. The ease with which HKW turns from the \"real\" world to the world of pirates and fairies and former Lost Boys. The author found a way to update the story and characters we knew and loved as children in a way that never makes us feel childish.\n\nWhat's not to like: I felt that there was more the author could have said. although the ending is perfectly appropriate, this quick read could have been longer, allowing HKW to explore these familiar-yet-new characters to delve more deeply into their familiar-yet-new relationships. In particular, the love triangle that emerges could have generated a wealth of chapters I'm still longing to read. The Darling boys seem somehow incomplete in this tale, since the story belongs to Wendy, Peter and Hook. It works, but I will forever have questions that could have been answered.\n\nFour stars for a tale told well. And, as _Wicked_ has caused to turn a jaundiced eye on Dorothy, so _Forever Neverland_ will never let me look at Peter Pan quite the same way again.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.43}, {"id": "21731", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nYou know, this is why I love reviewing because if I hadnt have been asked to review this series  I would have totally missed on something so good. Even at the third book; Im still interested, Im still loving the characters & their worlds and Im still left wanting more.\nThere are three Regent Vampire Lords in this world and the last one standing is Romaric who gleefully watched his other Lords be put through their paces by their Moiras, never expecting that his was just a stone throw away.. but there is a problem  Romaric already had a Moira, so can she really be his?\nIn the epilogue of book two Sarah is recovering in the refuge - after being held captive by the enemy for a month  she has just found out that she has sisters, she has just found out her heritage and is about to be mesmerised by the most beautiful man/vampire she has ever seen. Romaric sees Sarah and he knows shes his Moira, he has the overwhelming urge to claim her but is confused as to how this can be, so he does what any confused man doeshe runs.\nSarah is left confused by her feelings and with a sense of loss but it isn't long before Romaric comes back determined to make her his own. The thing is, Sarah is torn  how can she be with him when he didn't want her? How can she love one so scary and stoic, someone unwilling to share his past so they can have a future, someone who has rejected her more than once. One thing is for sure  Romaric has got his work cut out for him both in his personal life and professional because through his actions, he brings more than one enemy to his door and it could mean death for both him and Sarah.\n\nI loved this story, truly loved it! Sarah and Romaric make a great pairing; both are damaged, both need to open up but both are survivors in one way or another. I like how the women in this series challenge their men, they don't take things at face value, they question, they find facts and they dig the dirt up. They don't want to just sit there and be the pretty mate of a vampire, they put their time and effort into things they believe in, carving out their own path but also accepting that they are now the mate of a strong, protective man who acts like a caveman and I love the situations that arise when they demand something of their women only to be told no! Romaric is no exception, he has to play by Sarahs rules and wait for her to make decisions, yes it infuriates him but that doesnt mean its a bad thing. Romaric came across as quite clueless in how to have a relationship and it was funny when Dev & Damian try to give him advice. The going is quite emotional here as well because Sarah has demons from her time in captivity and Rom has them from his past so its clear that both need to open up to move forward  which is easier said than done for Rom. I loved watching their relationship progress though, its not easy when you're with someone who never opens up and just a showing of emotion is like a victory but I enjoyed how they bonded and eventually mated.\nThe storyline was extra packed this time because we a treat to more than one enemy. We know that one enemy has been about since the beginning of the series but in this one.. Romaric brings one of his own when he revisits a past that should have stayed there. As we get to know our couple we learn more about them and find that Sarah has some gifts, its through those gifts that she becomes invaluable to Roms survival  not that he knows it. She also enlists the help of someone to find her family tree with surprising results for both of them. The Lords are again trying to sort out the kidnappings, captivity, experiment drama and are gathering intel, they have help from an unexpected source -who may have been misjudged or is a victim of circumstance- and it looks like its the final showdown for enemy #1 but #2 is still waiting in the background and Romaric is very much involved in plotting and planning the downfall of that one too. There are a lot of threads in this that keep you really engrossed in the story - as well as the relationship  and through this we meet more people, see what a few of them are about and capable of which opens up the world that much more and Im really interested in a couple of the newbies. It all comes together for not one, but two showdowns that have some awesome twists and turns that leave you breathless and very satisfied but also wondering whats next for the Lords. Book 4 is set up in my opinion and definitely one I will look forward to but I want Mike & Giselles story soon.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

In the story we find an old vampire who is just living, not enjoying life and full of despair because he is the last vampire. He is the last because the enemy wiped them all out, very nearly Michael too but he survivedjust. Now he is alone, he cant turn any of the Dhampirs, cant breed and has no want for power..until he meets Claire. Her blood calls to him, he has never wanted anyone the way he wants Claire and one taste will never be enough.\nClaire was only trying to steal Michaels watch so she could afford her rent but there was something about him that pulled her into his arms, into doing things she wouldnt necessarily have done  but once the watch was her, she was gone.\nBoth Michael and Claire cant escape the connection they shared that night, he needs to find her because she is his tether she has given him his soul back and he can finally become the powerful vampire he is meant to be, he can create his race again but how can that be when Claire is human? Claire is thrust into Michaels world of blood and death as she becomes the target of an age old enemy who are determined to eradicate the vampire race once and for all.\nI really loved this book, it seems vampires are making a comeback lately and if they're all going to be like this then Im a happy lady! I liked the premise of the book with Michael being the last vampire and holding the fate of his race in his hands, we are given a few flashback scenes of Michael throughout the book to show what happened to them and why he was the only one left. Its plain to see that he is living half a life and is quite pitiful when we meet him, he even has to force himself to feed and all of the Dhampirs know that he is weak. Because he is the last of the ancient ones, he also carries the burden of being the one to hold all of the history of the vampires and the consciences of the slain collective and also the current dhampirs. This is a heavy burden indeed. He has practically given up hope when he finds Claire and it takes him a while to understand why he feels the way he does which gives Claire opportunity to leave, meaning he will have to find her. I thought Claire was a great character, you could tell she was a survivor and had those skills so she was never going to take the mating bond lying down. I like it when they fight like that, more times than enough the men are swept away with the realization that they have found their one and the women take some convincing which is so much fun to read. I loved the way these two clashed, both as stubborn as each other and unwilling to bend  that is until the bad guys came knocking. They definitely had the chemistry that makes you get involved in the relationship and that is topped with some nice sexytime and a great surprise.\nAs I said  the story was great and the premise too. I liked how the enemy was linked to Michaels past and how they made their presence known, there is also a few things to discover about the enemy too. Much of the story is about the relationship and how they get together, the enemy becoming more active and involved especially when its clear that Michael has found his mate but the story branches off for some of the secondary characters too which I enjoyed because I like to get to know everyone and know what is going on in all areas. This is done with multiple povs which I think enhanced the story here, it helped to build the other characters up so that you could get to know them more and also get into the mindset of the enemy who aren't short on their own drama either. There are also some great fight scenes and action throughout as Michael takes on anyone who means Claire harm, adding an element of danger that kept the plot exciting. I was very satisfied by the ending of the book, obviously with it being book one it is left open for more and book two seems set up so now just for the wait  great start though and Ill definitely be reading the sequel.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 3.18}, {"id": "21732", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis is a wonderful collection of stories about Gods love, joy and how He works his miracles in our lives.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There's a big issue here that needs to be addressed before my actual review of the collection because it is causing one-star \"reviews\" that unfairly drag down the rating of this interesting collection. Labels that license oldies like Varese Sarabande, and independent jazz and classical labels do not own factories. They send the master to factories, often owned by the big media companies, who make the discs for them. Rarely does an error occur but one that does is where the wrong music is put on a disc that otherwise has the right label imprint, booklet, etc. This happened here. But these things get caught quickly and fixed. I received a used copy with Rod McKuen on it. The seller credited me; most reputable sellers will. To be certain not to get another, since obviously some are out there, I ordered a new one. Everything is now fine and the correct music is on the disc.\n\nI would not recommend this disc as your only British Invasion disc. Many of the songs are not the really big hits and it has a very British orientation as seven of the 25 songs weren't even minor hits in America (which, after all is where the British Invasion happened. The Brits weren't invading Britain). I would recommend the Gold collection by Universal at the present time: 32 songs, big hits by big artists and great sound. Warner Brothers' great 9-disc series is out of print and as you can see here, tend to go for about $25 each or around $200 for the box. Universal's great 3-disc 54 song set (balloon on cover) is also out of print and also has gone high price. The time/Life 8-CD 1-DVD set goes all the way through the 80's (Police, Duran Duran, etc.) so it's not really \"The British Invasion\".\n\nThis disc it a great add-on to the Gold collection. Only one song is duplicated, (To Sir With Love), so it simply gives you some great extra songs. The usual suspects (Beatles, Stones, early Animals, Marianne Faithfull, Dave Clark Five and Herman's Hermits ) are missing due to their labels not liking to license them for collections. Varese Sarabande specializes in these kinds of things and they know what they are doing. You pick up extra songs by the Zombies, Donovan, the Animals, the Searchers and the Yardbirds, Also interesting one hit wonders like Unit Four Plus Two, Jonathan King, David & Jonathan, Crispian St. Peters, the Easybeats and Ian Whitcomb. Petula Clark is represented, one of the most glaring oversights of the Universal collections; she was considered more rock than Tom Jones (on UNI) and had consistent hits from '64 through '67.\n\nBut what about these other songs, the ones many people never heard of. Being Varese, these songs were wisely chosen (and they acknowledge they were only U.K. hits) because they were interesting for one reason or another. I was an avid British Invasion fan, listened to European radio on my shortwave radio, listened to WLS Chicago's British Countdown every Sunday and had a subscription to Billboard to follow the U.S. and British charts. When big hits in Britain started to not make it here in the summer of '65, I still heard them a lot and was excited to find big ones here like It's Good News Week and Tossing & Turning. The others are an obscure, untypical Dave Clark Five track on the Congress label (Epic/Columbia was their hit label); the Alan Price set was Price's bluesy group after he left the Animals, which he had founded; the Herd was Peter Frampton's first group; Long John Baldry founded Steampacket with Rod Stewart in the mid 60's;CHris Farlowe and Twice As Much were on Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate Records so it's no coincidence that they both do Stones' songs, Farlowe in a country-ish way and Twice As Much pure Sunshine Pop with a Baroque oboe to boot.\n\nAll this adds up to a great British Sixties Pop collection with many rare tracks that are a real gift being available all on one disc.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

But this compilation is really shoddy and that's why I'm warning Herman fans . Mostly it's old. Look at the date: 1990. This was still early for CDs and the sound was wretched. That's why there was such a rush to remaster CDs from around 1999 on; the labels were embarrassed by the sound. Also, not much care was given to 60s material; the groups were considered passe and it would be a decade before high quality reissue labels arrived on the scene. Fans will note that the songs aren't even in the right order chronologically. The only reason it ranks high here and has so many reviews is because it's been around so long. People gave it good reviews initially because it was the only one around and were really thinking how good the songs were, not the disc.\n\nIf you want the Hermits hits please do yourself a BIG favor and spend the extra $5.00 and get the collection titled \"Retrospective\". It has all the singles, even minor ones like East West that are absent here, and late ones like I Can Take or Leave Your Loving, also not here. The sound is incredible, remastered by people who cared. And please note that both discs are by the same label, ABKCO. They were aware of how bad this disc was and fixed the problem.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 2.06}, {"id": "21735", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThe Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, Fritz Rayburn is murdered and his sixteen year-old stepgranddaughter Hannah Sheraton is arrested. Her mother, Linda turns to her old college roommate Josie Baylor-Bates for help. At one time, Josie was a \"hotshot\" criminal defense attorney, but she has left that life behind her and settled into a small practice in Hermosa Beach, California. When Hannah is charged as an adult, Josie decides to help her...\n\nJosie is haunted by memories of something that happened to her mother  and an old case where she defended a woman named Kristin Davis  it was her last case as before she left the \"fast track\" behind. After that case, Josie \"realized she no longer had the stomach for defending those who should have been indefensible\" ...\n\nI was engrossed in this book from page one and I did not put it down until I reached the very last sentence. The characters are richly drawn, you can visualise each of them in great detail  all the way to seeing Hannah's cuts and her frightened eyes. You feel like a spectator as you watch the courtroom drama unfold. It is fascinating to follow the clues and evidence and try to figure out the whodunnit. I thought I knew early on who murdered Fritz Rayburn and why, but I was wrong. The real culprit was a bit of a surprise to me...\n\nThis book has all of the ingredients necessary for a great legal thriller: secrets in a wealthy family and the lengths they will go to to keep those secrets from being exposed; a tenacious defense attorney ready to put it all on the line for a mentally traumatised young girl she believes is innocent; excitement as the courtroom drama plays out  and the desire to find out the truth no matter what...\n\nI was very impressed with the details of Hannah's mental disorder that were included in the book  it is very clear to me that the author cared enough to take the time to do the research...\n\nI am a new Rebecca Forster fan and I will definitely be reading the rest of The Witness Series!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

After their many trials and tribulations, they finally find a place where they are isolated and feel safe. But everything is not what it seems to be, and soon they find themselves involved in a fight for their very lives Is this a fight Hannah and Billy can win? Can Josie and Archer find them before it is too late?\n\nWithout giving away details, the subject matter covered in this book was very interesting and intriguing. You hear about this sort of thing a lot  and maybe see a news story every now and then (I do not live in America, so I am not sure how often it happens, but I have studied psychology there and remember a few very important \"big news\" cases). I believe Ms. Forster did a brilliant job of exploring the psychological aspects of the overall situation  this is definitely the best and most thought-out example that I have read in fiction.\n\nThe location of this book was also described in great detail. I was able to visualise the surroundings (beautiful images, in my mind) and all of different people with many different ways of life (the characters in this story are alike in some ways and very different in others). I could almost feel the coldness and experience the darkness of the night...\n\nEach of the Josie Bates Thrillers (The Witness Series) has been better than the last and this one is no exception. The book was thoroughly entertaining and kept me turning the pages, anxious to find out what direction the story might go next. As soon as I thought I had figured out exactly what was happening, something would change my mind. I did pick out the loony toons of the story, but I think you were meant to. However, having said that, I did not know how far some characters were willing to go until the very last. A great book with a 5-star ending, in this fans opinion!\n\nAfterThought: There is an error on the \"blurb\" for this book.

I don't know what the plot is, other than there are shape shifters and she's something special but I don't know what. That isn't too uncommon by the middle of the book, but if the story is good, the characters are alive, and the writing's decent I look past it. But it isn't. There is a lot of filler that simply doesn't add anything to the book. Basically, there are two hot dudes chasing after some chick. Throw in some mean girls and mix with a couple of good friends, and flirt with the idea of a love triangle. (I'm assuming that's going to happen by the way the cousin is acting towards her.)\nI liked it when the chick called her friend a cheeky cow. Too bad it wasn't out loud.

I love Japan and everything about it, but there aren't that many YA books set in this place and the books that are tend to be based mainly in the past. The author gives us a glimpse into the contemporary Japan and using imagery and humor shows us many of the places and things that I would love to see for myself one day. I also loved how she was able to interweave a lot of the culture and mythology of Japan without making it seem like a history lesson.\n\nThen there was the paranormal aspect to the story. I really liked the unusual powers the characters had with Ink and trying to figure out exactly what it was and how it worked. There was a lot we learned about it, but just as many questions arose from it as well and I can't wait to find out more in the next book.\n\nKatie is a really strong willed character and I really admired her spirit. I liked that although she made mistakes she still kept trying. Just like when she was trying to learn the language. At first she wasn't that great at it and even though her friends didn't mind speaking to her in English she chose to keep on trying and perfect her Japanese instead of just giving up. She is a fun character to get to know and a bit quirky at times too.\n\nTomohiro was an interesting character and although I was a bit leery of him at first I really came to like him right along with Katie. He keeps to himself and for good reason, but once you get past that hard outer shell he really is a sweety and really funny. I love how he interacts with Katie and the way he sometimes teases her. It is so much fun to see them together. It was also great that he could also be so lighthearted and have a sense of humor about things given the situation he is in. I think he and Katie make a great team and I can't wait to see more of them.\n\nI also loved Katie's two friends Yuki and Tanaka. Yuki is one of her first friends and she is one of my favorites. She is always cheerful and a lot of fun to be around kind of likes Tanaka who is a bit of a goofball. I liked how supportive they were of Katie even when things got really weird. They are definitely the kind of people I would love to be friends with.\n\nOverall this is an exciting read with an imaginative new world that I am dying to read more of!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The setting was the perfect backdrop to this hauntingly beautiful story. I was drawn in to the story from the first page and was constantly surprised. Just as I thought I knew what or who was behind everything something happened to throw me off. The author did a great job of giving small hints and clues throughout the story without giving away the entire mystery.\n\nThe romance was sweet and not too overdone. There was just enough to keep me interested without completely taking over the story. I also liked how it gradually built throughout the story instead of just being thrown out there. The characters weren't instantly in love instead they slowly came to know one another and became friends. I can't wait to see how their relationship progresses in the rest of the series.\n\nChira is an outcast and is not used to hanging around anyone other than her best friend Tasha. That is until she strikes up a a small friendship with the new boy Ben. She is a smart, loyal, and brave young woman that I enjoyed getting to know. I also liked seeing the growth in her character throughout the book. She started out as a bit of a loner, throwing up guards to keep people out. However by the end she had finally ventured out and gained friendships that she had never thought would happen.\n\nBen is an unusual, but very intriguing boy who has a very kind heart. He is very sweet and a bit shy, but once you get to know him he can be very charming. I enjoyed the banter between him and Chira they really knew how to make each other smile even when they were teasing each other. Ben also has a dark secret one that he doesn't like to talk about, but even so he does his best to try to protect people. He is a bit misunderstood, but it was so easy to fall in love with his adorable self.\n\nMatt is Ben's cousin and the last to join their little group. It was a bit tense with him and Chira at first, but with his carefree attitude and easy jokes it's hard not to smile around Matt. We don't get yo see as much about Matt In this book, but I do hope to see more about him in future ones.\n\nThis is an exciting start to a promising new series and I highly recommend it to fans of mystery, suspense, and the paranormal!\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.65}, {"id": "21752", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nSeriously, the biblical inspiration in this book is all well and good,  but it IS our food that is causing the problem!\n\nSimply stop eating the processed junk in the center of the store, and eat REAL food like God intended... fruits, nuts, seeds (ALL seeds are edible, even apple seeds and watermelon Genesis 1:27-29).

I found the main idea of this novel to be completely original, and I couldn't put the book down.  The protagonist, Alex, was fierce and I enjoyed how rough the setting of this novel was.  It wasn't a glamorous setting, and showed what would happen if the world was taken over by this mysterious force called The Roar.  I felt that the Earth in this novel was fighting back against the human race, and that is something that we all need to think about in today's times.  A.M. White's writing style is also extremely poetic, and reading her novel was a literary treat.  One of my favorite examples of her styles from The Roar is as follows:\n\n\"With each ram of the shovel, puffs of my breath escaped and floated away.  My eyes watched my breath drift from the ditch and get lost in the sky above.  I wondered if that is how our soul leaves the body.\"\n\nThis quote alone showed me how deep of a thinker and author she is, to put so much meaning into small things such as puffs of breath.  Her style reminds me of classic authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nBut the only problem I had with this novel was the ending.  It was too abrupt for my tastes, and the cliffhanger made the novel seem almost incomplete.  I always try to tell authors to steer clear from the cliffhanger ending, due to the fact that many times it can turn the reader off and make them feel that the author is forcing them to buy the sequel.  If this ending were more complete and made the novel appear as a standalone, I would have given it an astounding 5/5.\n\nBut overall, I loved this novel.  I loved how gritty the plot and characters were, and I loved the originality of it.  The editing was also perfect, and the interior layout of the book was very professional.  I will gladly pick up the rest of the books in this series when they are released, and I do think that this book is perfect for readers who want dystopian novels that aren't similar to anything else in the current market.  White is a master of her words, description, and plot and I completely lost myself in this novel.  The main character of Alex rings with the same tough personality as Katniss from The Hunger Games, but in my opinion Alex is an even better developed character, and I can proudly say that she is now one of my favorite characters of all time.\n\nScorecard\n\nEditing: 5/5\nOriginality: 5/5\nArtistic Style: 5/5\nPlot Development: 4/5 - due to incomplete ending\nCharacter Development: 5/5\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Not only did he paint his own cover (which I found to be brilliant), he used his words to paint a story as well.  With all of the apocalyptic novels out there, I thought that this novel might not be as original as it could be, but I was very wrong.\n\nTurk's story and ideas are something that I have never seen before in a novel, and I enjoyed thoroughly the idea that humans are creating their own death traps.  Even though this novel follows the idea that the government and corporate officials are the ones creating man made disasters to destroy life, I felt that this was also a metaphor for how we as a race are destroying the earth and writing our own death sentences.  Joe Turk was clever with his words, and through reading this novel I felt as though each scene and character were being painted before me.\n\nFor my reviews, the biggest aspect that I judge on is originality and this novel received a well deserved 5/5 for that.  I didn't feel that I had read the story so many times before; instead, I felt that I was reading a story that was well thought out and had been mulled over for quite a long time.  In today's day and age, I think that this novel came at the perfect time due to the conflicts that we are currently facing based on how we have treated our planet.  I also think that Turk wanted the reader to understand that it isn't the earth that we should be afraid of, but our fellow humans.  However, this novel wasn't preachy and only presented the reader with a situation that is much needed at this time in the world.  I am gladly giving this book 5/5 and I am sure that, no matter what genres you prefer, this book will leave a lasting impression.\n\nIf you enjoy Dystopian/Apocalyptic novels, then this book is the one for you.

It made me smile and swoon all at once, dazzled me with its wintery setting, and hit me with a great amount of feels I wouldn't trade for in the world.\n\nI have some serious love for Dylan because she was admirable in her self discovery, in her love for Sawyer and in her independence, strength, and devotion. She was not perfect though she strived to be. Dylan had her own fears and doubts that led her to realize what she truly wanted out of her life. She learned to let go of her inhibitions, to lose some control, and allowed herself to do and feel things out of her comfort zone. Even when she bruised and fell on her a** while trying to snowboard she kept trying no matter how discouraged she felt. I was more than inspired and proud of Silver for the decisions she made in the end. Also memorable was Silver's love for lime Popsicles and private lessons. They bring on a whole new meaning for me. *winks*\n\nSo lets talk about a certain sexy snowboarder by the name of Sawyer Carter. Why on earth should you love, adore and worship Carter the Carver? Well, because he snowboards (duh), has light green eyes (swoons) and has several significant tattoos that makes me want to...(licks). But really, it's because Sawyer is charmingly sweet, ambitious, caring, daring, and accomplished. He's flirty and funny and says the most breathtaking lines that are genuine and sincere. He lights up the room, grabs attention but he is never arrogant in his success or superiority. He makes your heart melt, your knees weak, and makes you want to sigh in contentment every time he is around. Most especially, he pushes Dylan to be true to herself. Sawyer Carter makes me want to jump his snowboard and ride on the slopes all day. *giggles*\n\nI loved what Victoria Green created in Silver Heart because it was profoundly poignant, steamy hot, and clever all the way. Her writing gives off a strong, mature, and prominent voice in Dylan. She makes Dylan and everything she goes through to be connectable and relatable. The added humor, witty lines, and silly jokes make the book even more well rounded. Not only the romance was established and developed well, but the friendship between Silver and Sawyer that started it all was too. What I loved most about their relationship was the acceptance, support, and understanding they gave each other. The honesty, being able to admit their mistakes to one another, and how both refused to stand in the way of the other's dreams was truly beautiful. I also commend Victoria on her ability to write combustable sexual tension that climbed higher and higher. The make out scenes were sexy, the touching scenes were sensual, and the sex scenes were thoroughly seductive. I officially love ledges and horny forest rangers! They're best things in life. Victoria impressed me so much because she made Silver Heart truly realistic from the characters, to the romance, to whole storyline and everything in between.\n\nI do have to mention another thing I love about Silver Heart and that's Dylan's brother, Adam Silver. Let's meet in an on-call room one day, my love.\n\nOverall, Silver Heart was phenomenally written with the perfect balance of beauty, inspiration, wit and romantic love.

I must say that the cover drew me to the book originally, but when I read the blurb I was completely hooked. I can never resist two brothers fighting over a girl. There is just something about it that is so forbidden and wrong and just exciting.\n\n''In If I Can't Have You, fifteen year old Robin nearly drowns during her summer vacation in Paradise. Just when she thinks she's about to die, a handsome lifeguard, Drake, saves her life. From there on, Robin has this infatuation with Drake. Sadly, he only sees her as the fifteen year old she really is. He goes so far as to giving Robin a nickname: \"kid.\" This does not discourage Robin at all. For the next three years, she puts Drake on a pedestal. In Robin's eyes, no one can compare to Drake, he is her perfect guy in every way. Now that she's 16 going on 17, Robin is determined to get Drake's attention and make him hers before she goes off to college. But one more thing is getting in the way of Robin's plans; his name is Elliot and he happens to be Drake's younger brother.\n\n''Lauren Hammond really surprised me with this book. I wasn't sure what to expect, but  with what I read, I absolutely loved it. I've already said that this book is super addicting. It's such an easy and quick read that I was able to read this book in one sitting, in less than a day. Lauren managed to have me sucked into this story with Robin and I was more than happy to stay in it forever. It's set in Paradise, a vacation spot, that Robin goes to every summer. Not only does Lauren make this setting completely visual in my mind's eye, but she really brought the summer feel into the book. If I Can't Have You is a perfect read when you're lounging around near the beach getting a tan. ''\n\nI really enjoyed Robin as the main character. She's sort of keeps to herself, but she's not a loner and she's still able to have friends. She's not the most beautiful girl in the world, but she's got a good heart. Robin made pretty good decisions throughout the book. She's smart, thinks things through and she's pretty level headed. She had her mess ups and mistakes, but that's only normal. I thought Robin was more realistic because of these qualities. She seemed like just an average girl that anyone can relate to. What I loved was that I really could understand Robin and her infatuation with Drake. It's only normal at such a young age to see this person as her savior and believe he is all good and honorable. I get why she liked him for so long because I have been through this and I'm sure other readers will say the same too. I also thought that Robin handled certain situations with her head held up high and I was damn proud of her for admitting her mistakes despite the fact that it almost cost her in the end. ''\n\nAnother shining aspect of this book was the fact that I did not see what was coming with Drake and Elliot. I honestly believed things would go down differently than it did and I was more than surprised by the outcome of the story. I loved the twists that Lauren added. She also does a great job of making the Robertson brothers (Drake and Elliot) different. You can distinguish the brothers a part and I love that both have good and bad qualities that make each realistic. I especially loved all the steamy hot scenes that Lauren really brought into the book. I was swooning and sighing and just wishing I was Robin. ''\n\nOverall, If I Can't Have You was a spectacular read. It's humorous and filled with passion and sweet sweet romance that I couldn't get enough of. I'm definitely reading more books from Lauren Hammond!

The screen can only convey a very few ideas that a book can. What make the 600 pages of this book average is that it is no better than a movie. It's like Asher crossed 1979's Moonraker with Total Recall. I saw Moonraker as a child at the movie theater. Even at that age, I thought the movie's \"space marine\" battles were cheesy. Here we are in 2012, the distant future, and the same battle in \"The Departure\" is just as silly.\n\nBeing the first part of a planned trilogy, this book has no other purpose than getting the star (Alan Saul) from A to B. Hence the title. Stripped of his personality and reconfigured into a killer, I wonder if Saul had ever heard of Jason Bourne. Throw in the ultimate expression of the European Union's soulless bureaucracy, and you have a science fiction winner, right? Wrong. The deadened depressiveness of Euro-tocracy made for a joyless novel, I found myself wishing it would end. I don't want to read two more parts.\n\nAsher's writing, usually inventive and fun, was too close to real life with its depiction of evil bureaucrats living the high life. Last year, the EU bureacrats declared that bottled water manufacturers could not claim that water rehydrated people who drank it (UK Telegraph: \"EU bans claim that water can prevent dehydration\"). The bureaucrats who made that ruling were probably paid hundreds of thousands of Euros per year to make that absurd conclusion.\n\nSorry Asher, those bureaucrats won't have to wait another century to have their lavish lifestyles stripped from them. Real life is more horrifying than the dystopia you're trying to craft here.\n\nWorking in a space station that is moved out of orbit (just like Deep Space Nine's 2-hour pilot), and the story got a little too unbelievable. Having an evil manager in two plotlines (on Earth and Mars) was just too trite and annoying. The \"amazing online torture\" was so routine as to be yawn-inducing. Try using Windows 7, Asher, then you'll know digital terror that has no equal. Again, real life realities are more scary than the future he depicts.\n\nI did like a small mention of the late Babylon 5 actor Andreas Katsulas (an anagram for a character therein), and the \"Inspectorate\" has the ring of \"Expectorate\", a clever turn to describe the new world order. I do like his premise that the world is run by vain idiots. And yes, it is possible for Europeans to choose governments that murder them by the millions. But this book did not evoke the sense of wonder I expect from Asher.\n\nThree stars mean that I expect Asher to improve his world in the next two books. I just wonder whether I will bother with them, given the exceptionally dreary tone of this one. Go read Prador Moon, or Africa Zero (deleted from Asher's official works listing). Asher notes in his dedication that some fans think his literary output is too slow. With this work, it is obvious he needs to slow down. This book was all fast-pace and zero personality.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Hamilton, for stealing the plot from Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Hamilton gives the reader two stories here, about a far future civilization that is menaced by dreams being sent from the center of the galaxy. At the same time, the reader is regaled with a 'dream' of a primitive civilization living a cruder form of existence. A faction of human religious fanatics (won't they ever go out of style?) want to fly into the galactic center to join the dream. And a coalition of alien races and human artificial intelligences want to stop them, for fear of what the 'God' in the center of the galaxy will do as punishment to the surrounding star systems. Sound familiar? All that's missing is Sybok, and a trip to El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.\n\nI truly wanted to believe in Hamilton's latest fantasy offering. After all, I re-read his entire Night's Dawn Trilogy, and that's something I've never done for any other science fiction author. In that series, he had 21st-century characters and more primitive types attempting to react to the modern galactic federation they found themselves in. It was a way to draw the reader into an unfamiliar setting. No such primitive analogue exists for readers of this trilogy. All the characters in the future are inaccessible, remote, and beyond anything we can conceive. And yet, people are still murderously amoral, just for more lofty reasons. Whatever. I found myself bored with the characters we were supposed to identify with and follow, and flipping past the 'dream' chapters whenever they came up. This distant future of humanity is all fantasy and no science fiction. He might as well have saved himself the trouble and made this a sorcery fantasy with the characters seeking a mysterious lair in a remote mountain. If you're looking for more of Hamilton's gorgeously realized hard scifi, steer clear of all three books.

It's hard to synthesize them into a coherent review, so I'm just going to summarize what I liked and disliked.\n\nOn the plus side:\n\nEasy to read: The story is told as a first-person narrative by the main protagonist, Dolores. Though her actions can be exasperating to the point where you want to shake some sense into her, she is always engaging, keeping a sense of (sometimes gallows) humor as she recreates her story. And it's impossible not to admire Lamb's skill in writing from the perspective of an overweight, overwhelmed woman as he tracks her history over the 25-year span of the book.\n\nGrowth and development: It's incremental, it's painful, there is backsliding - but there is growth. The ending offers a measure of comfort, but to a degree that seems deliberately subdued - there is no fairy-tale ending here. Lamb is showing us that adversity can be overcome, but doing so is hard work. And don't get too comfortable - any ground that you gain in life could be lost overnight. There is something completely admirable in the way that Dolores doesn't simply buckle, but - against considerable odds - manages to reach a level of self-awareness that affords her a measure of contentment in her own skin\n\nAs against that: (WARNING - SOME PLOT DETAILS INCLUDED)\n\nHard to read: For the same reasons that the book of Job is not your favorite book of the bible. The tribulations just keep coming. Guilt about parents divorcing? Daddy abandonment issues? That's just the baseline. Let's pile on a little molestation, rape, 150 or so excess pounds, several years in a psychiatric facility, peer rejection and gratuitous cruelty, marriage to a philandering narcissist, abortion, and the death of almost everyone dear to you. You can almost hear Satan betting with that dear old-Testament God, as further trials are heaped on. Dolores's failure to conceive is almost a relief - at least we're spared the prospect of a child-immolation scene.\n\nGrowth and development: Wait now. Didn't I list this under the `things to like' section? Well, yes I did. So sue me for also disliking it. Because there is that unavoidable Oprah sticker right on the cover of this book. It's completely obvious why - the kind of uplift that is doled out makes this book a shoo-in for Oprah-approval. But it's hard not to feel that one is being emotionally manipulated throughout, on a grand scale. To which my -  admittedly irrational - response is \"If you're going to play the reader like a cheap violin, then at least have the decency to provide more of a feel-good ending than you do\".\n\nDead whale metaphors: Give me a break! Was this really necessary? Best you could come up with? Why not just club the reader over the head and have done with it?\n\nAlso, if I were a lesbian, I think I'd be within my rights to be offended by this book.\n\nYou can tell I'm all over the map where this book is concerned. Which means it got under my skin more than I might like to admit. Which is what allows it to keep its third star.\n\nIn the end, a book more to admire than to like.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

In particular, I read all 600 pages in under two days, which should give an idea of its appeal.\n\nFor me, its strengths were:\n\n* It's a sprawling portrait of two (upper)middle-class English families, spanning a 20-year period, beginning in 1974, locating it firmly within Britain's Thatcher years. (I have a certain fondness for well-constructed family stories).\n* Hensher is really terrific at capturing the dynamics of relationships within a family, as well as exploring his characters' inner lives.\n* He can be very funny for long stretches; he can also write very movingly about intra-family tensions and loyalties.\n* With one glaring exception, the characters are believable, and he keeps us interested, even though the events of their lives, objectively viewed, are pretty mundane.\n* The various story arcs are well-constructed, believable, with satisfying resolutions (with one exception).\n\nSo if you like a nice, generation-spanning family drama that's a 'good read', \"The Northern Clemency\" definitely has something to offer.\n\nBut I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't warn you that:\n\n* The book could have been quite a bit shorter. At 600 pages, it cries out for editing. For instance, Hensley appears incapable of having one of his characters order a drink without telling us the height, weight, hair color and demeanor of the bartender, as well as what he's wearing. (There's a particularly egregious 4-page section later on in the book where an office cleaning lady, Rosalie, is introduced. We learn about her relationships with her heroin-addicted son, with the different security guards in the building where she cleans offices at night, with the late-shift supervisor, Brendan, her nosy neighbors etc. We learn that Rosalie has grit and is a survivor. But her only function in the story is to allow the reader a glimpse of something one of the main characters has thrown in her office wastebasket. And it's not even anything particularly revealing.)\n* Then there's what appears to be a mild food obsession on Hensher's part. Description of a fish pie can run to two pages. Canapes and appetizers receive similar attention, bordering on the fetishistic.\n* As a reviewer, Hensher has expressed his disdain for other authors' use of easy cultural references, such as pop songs, to evoke a particular point in time. He correctly identifies it as lazy writing. Apparently it doesn't bother him, in his own writing, to use vol-au-vents, shag carpeting, and the mention of very specific TV programs to do the exact same thing.\n* Although the book is set in Sheffield, against the backdrop of the miners' strike and Thatcher's response, there is no political commentary of any real depth. To be fair, Hensher may wish to make the (valid) point that even during periods of (relative) political turmoil, the interest and engagement of the upper middle class was virtually nil. But his development of Tim, the troubled youngest kid in one of the families as a caricature Trotskyite who is laden with every tired cliche in the book is  lazy and ultimately boring.\n* Occasionally, the plot just meanders into a completely implausible digression - there are parts when the novel reflects the often undirected, aimless character of everyday life a little too faithfully. I must confess that this didn't bother me all that much, as Hensher generally manages to keep things entertaining, and often very funny, throughout.\n\nI enjoyed \"The Northern Clemency\" a lot, warts and all, and found it compulsively readable. Readers who liked Jonathan Franzen's \"The Corrections\" should enjoy it; if you hated \"The Corrections\", give it a miss.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.52}, {"id": "21767", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nAfter reading all 59 book I can only give  a 4.

After all, patience may be a virtue but who wants to wait around to find out how a story they're waist-deep in concludes?  Such was the case with Romeo x Juliet.  The first collection (known as the Romeo Collection) hit streets on June 23rd and now the concluding set is at our collective disposal as of August 11.\n\nRomeo x Juliet from Funimation breaks the 24 total episodes into a pair of two-disc sets. The second of which (reviewed here) is known as The Juliet Collection and contains episodes 13-24. Packaged within an appropriately artistically decorated cardboard exterior slipcase is a pair of thin disc cases each containing a single dvd (with 6 episodes on each).\n\nTotal runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears a conservative TV PG (13+) rating, based presumably more on the grander adult oriented themes (we do all know how this tale will end) than it is language, sexual scenarios, or gore.\n\nLanguage options are standard fair sub & dub meaning the original Japanese dialog track is presented (in stereo) as well as the option of instead watching an English dub (in Dolby Surround 5.1). Finally English subtitles are available with either vocal option.\n\nExtras include an English actor commentary track over Act (episode) 24, textless songs, and a host of Funimation trailers on the second disc.\n\nAs was the case with the first collection, the source material here deviates from the original William Shakespeare play while retaining many of the same fundamental concepts of forbidden love, dictatorship governments, and the agony of heartbreak.\n\nIn this installment Prince Montague sentences the captured Juliet to death, which of course spurs her faithful comrades into rescue efforts. For simply aiding in Juliet's escape, Romeo finds himself exiled to the grueling Gradisca mines.\n\nThough ripped apart from one another, both Romeo and Juliet focus their efforts to create a world where they can be together while Juliet cements a Capulet strike against Montague complete with the return of her vigilante alter ego, the Red Whirlwind.\n\nWhile the human factions battle each other for control, Neo Verona itself is crumbling as Escalus, the tree that supports everything, begins to wither and die beneath their very feet.\n\nPacing in the show's second half is much grander in terms of scale and scope when compared to that of the first 12 episodes.  The love interest between the title characters definitely blossoms into a more believable/ less forced relationship here even as the underlying chaos that surrounds them builds to a fever pitch.\n\nWithout giving away too many spoilers, I will say to expect some of the tragic nature of the source material to not only carry over but to become a literal ultimatum faced by the characters by the show's dramatic conclusion.\n\nHowever, I really don't wish to insinuate that the entire Juliet Collection serves as a funnel to the inevitable conclusion; in fact the truth is quite the contrary.  Thanks to the fact that this half of the tale once again consists of a full 12 episodes should hint toward the truth that the voyage is every bit as rewarding as the arrival.\n\nI was particularly moved by the sequences that focused on Romeo's torture in the mines, as they appear to have been lifted from some of the finer science fiction films of yore and work very well here.  Juliet's isolated plots were a bit drier and more politically under-toned but I suspect some may find this to be the more enjoyable.\n\nPrince Montague's tyranny really comes into fruition in this installment as well; a credit to Gonzo's ability to paint realistic characters (love them or hate them).\n\nLike in the first half, the artistry is by no means spectacular but it does work within this setting with emphasis on textures and background detail, sometimes at the cost of the moment.  The musical score however continues to build both in scale and mood.  Ultimately, it comes off as a very well constructed symphonic score that manages to impress (even in the show's darker moments).\n\nOnce again I'm left with mixed feelings on the occasional old-English/ Shakespearean-inspired dialog on the English dub, which may actually be superior to the original Japanese dialog (a rarity in the anime world).  It's not quite as glaring an inconsistency as it was in the first installment, but it without fail makes the viewer wonder if it would have worked better to quit resisting and just perform the entire show that way or to avoid any and all references to that era and simply do away with it entirely.\n\nThe English voice cast commentary track is great in terms of demonstrating just what a highly anticipated project the show was to Funimation.  It's funny to hear that nearly everyone on staff did their absolute best in the hopes of snagging one of the lead roles.  Of course the producers had to narrow it down and surely there were those lowly voice actors left feeling like the last person on the wall during team selection of a gym class dodge ball game.\n\nIn all, this is a must have for those who watched, loved, liked, or even just barely got through the first half.  For everyone else, this is definitely above average anime as a whole and now that the full 24-epiodes are available, this would be the perfect opportunity to get involved.

Instead what we have is a uniquely animated drama based loosely on the classic source material from anime masters, Gonzo.\n\nReleased for the first time ever on DVD, Romeo x Juliet from Funimation breaks the 24 total episodes into a pair of two-disc sets.  The first of which (reviewed here) is known as The Romeo Collection and contains episodes 1-12.  Packaged within an appropriately artistically decorated cardboard exterior slipcase is a pair of thin disc cases each containing a single dvd (with 6 episodes on each).\n\nTotal runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears a conservative TV PG (13+) rating, based presumably more on the grander adult oriented themes (we do all know how this tale will end) than it is language, sexual scenarios, or gore.\n\nLanguage options are standard fair sub & dub meaning the original Japanese dialog track is presented (in stereo) as well as the option of instead watching an English dub (in Dolby Surround 5.1).  Finally English subtitles are available with either vocal option.\n\nTo paraphrase the opening set-up:  The story takes place once upon a time, in the sky continent known as New Verona where the all-powerful ability to hover in the distant sky breathes life and prosperity upon the people. However, foolish passions will someday transcend eternity. Now let me introduce to you the tragic story of innocent pure love tormented by fate in the midst of chaos, Romeo and Juliet.\n\nIn the event that this doesn't help you understand the story better, imagine a blend of European 1600s culture with some mythological elements peppered about for greater intrigue.  The main source of transportation on New Verona happens to be winged horses and let us not forget that this continent is in fact floating high in the sky.\n\nJust like with the play, Gonzo structured the classic Montague versus Capulet struggle as the immediate and driving force of the prose.  However the show does take some interesting liberties fairly early on in the form of young Juliet donning a wig and mask to pose as a male superhero who delivers justice in a severely corrupted and hierarchal society.\n\nThe star-crossed lover angle between the lead characters takes little time in starting but develops quite slowly; oftentimes painfully so.  There is little doubt that this show could have succeeded as a 12 or more-standard 13-episode show but was pushed to 24 due to Japanese broadcast television specifics.  As such, expect some story threads to fizzle out and others to drag on needlessly.\n\nIn the spans where things are progressing smoothly, the lead characters and their motivations are quite well done (save perhaps for the few times a wig can completely baffle everyone to the fact that Juliet is a female; especially when Romeo and his winged horse encounter the \"male\" version).\nVisuals are definitely high budget Gonzo territory and this fact is clear nearly immediately.  The character cells maintain a sort of washed out appearance that adds to the feel of antiquity to the equation while the backgrounds are lavish and rich with impressive lighting effects throughout.\n\nSound work is solid with a dub that succeeds on some levels but fails at others.  A very deliberate approach was taken early on by the voice talents to eliminate the old-English speaking style of the original work but then often (and out of nowhere) a character will slip into a bit of clich&eacute; old style of speaking only to nearly as quickly recover.  The Japanese audio avoids these pitfalls entirely but comes off as lackluster in some of the key critical moments.  Choose your poison, as it were.\n\nMusic score is very appropriate with nice fluctuations at the tense moments and subtle inflections when things get delicate.  In all I came into the show with hopes of Gonzo having duplicated the effort that made Gankutsuou work compared to Alexander Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo.  Unfortunately, it appears as though the problem with Romeo x Juliet is that the source material on which it is based was simply too ambitious from the onset.  In effort to make a modernized tale of the Shakespeare play feasible, blown tender moments and miscued romantic scenarios were perhaps inevitable.  Still, you have to give Gonzo credit for even attempting such a feat.  In the end it comes off more as a minor derailment than a total train wreck.  However, suburb visuals, smooth music work, and deliberate pacing may make this one worth looking into regardless of how it compares to the source material.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 3.46}, {"id": "21769", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nAlright, my first go around went terribly with this thing but I've now got it working.

On one of the songs I listened to anytime they pronounced an S word the S sound was almost painful.  Maybe good for footsteps but not music.  One thing I'll give these headphones over my 5.1 setup is you can place sounds extremely well.  In Bf3 I got a nice extra kill hearing someone behind me.\n\nAlso someone mentioned a .2 sec or something delay in the sound - the sound comes out at the exact same time as my regular speakers so ignore that.\nCurrent setup, HDMI to receiver for my home sound, then the separate dongle with optical out (xbox 360) into the XP500 for headphones sound.  You can have both on at once.\n\nBatteries:\nThey eat your controller batteries (xbox 360) if you do the wireless chat as well as having a demand on the headphone batteries.  You plug a blue tooth thing into the controller which lets you talk via xbox live and it eats up your controller batteries.  The headset also takes 2 double A batteries.  I ordered a wired talkback cable&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Turtlebeach-X31-X41-X11-PX21-PX5-XP400-XP500-Xbox-Live-Talkback-Cable-Puck-Black-TB450-2181-01-Official-Replacement-Cable-NEW/dp/B008BVUOBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Turtlebeach X31/X41/X11/PX21/PX5/XP400/XP500 Xbox Live Talkback Cable Puck Black (TB450-2181-01) Official Replacement Cable NEW</a>&nbsp;to try and help with the battery thing.  I'll update if it helps.  As soon as you unplug the blue tooth the controller low battery indicator goes away.  Rechargeable batteries don't keep as much juice as fresh new batteries and mine were just not lasting at all... Update: the talkback cable preserves your controller batteries pretty well.  Use it instead of the Bluetooth.\n\nWireless Interference?:\nI have Verizon Fios and their wireless router with my wifi PC, wireless mouse and keyboard and they all work just fine with the headset in use.  THOUGH, if I walk to the other side of the room the headset will start picking up static.  Also a funny little bit, if I connect my phone to the wifi and start browsing pages on my phone, the headset will pick up static each time a new page loads.  So I guess it depends on what you have for wifi in your house.\n\nSetup:\nI felt it was kind of limited.  You have to use Optical cable to the wireless transmitter for surround sound.  It has an Optical in and an Optical out.  It also has the old Red and White in for stereo sound.  I believe you can hook your headphones up wired if you get a toslink to toslink optical cable (or you can buy adapters)  It looks like headphone cable end except it has an optical tip.  That's how I setup my PC to use its sound.  I have an iMac and all apple pc headphone jacks double as toslink optical cable outputs.  (I'm not an apple buff, I'm currently running windows on this thing, just had to mention)\nAnd of course for power there's a usb to transmitter wire.\n\nOh and you can only have one wireless headset hooked up, you can do another wired but one is the max for wireless on the transmitter.  Max 2, one wired, one wireless.\n\nOh, I did fail to mention it has blue tooth so you can connect it with your phone and play music on it that way.  Pretty cool.  Hold the blue tooth button down on the headset when turning on blue tooth mode and it should say blue tooth pairing (or turn it off first).  Then look for it on your phone.  It uses the chat (blue tooth) volume control, not the main one.\n\nProgrammable:\nDon't care, haven't tried.  Btw presets are just bad.\n\nI was thinking about returning them but I'll probably just hold on to them.  I mean they work so why not, can't say I'd recommend them to anyone though.  If you just want to spoil yourself and don't care about the money then maybe.  That's where I was when I bought them.  :)  But don't expect them to redefine sound for you if you already have a good speaker setup.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 2.7}, {"id": "21770", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nWhen craving comfort food, like chocolate chip cookies, these are amazing.

Diagnosed with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), I feel the need to put everything in a specific place in a specific order.  I am especially particular about my kitchen spaces.  After working in restaurants for over a decade, my kitchen is my place of zen.  So when asked if I'd be willing to review the Silicone Stove Counter Gap Cover by Kohzie in exchange for a discount, I quickly agreed.\n\nNothing drives me more nuts than when food drips into any crack I can't easily clean it from let alone the side of the stove.  When it drops down there, it requires me to move my oven completely out of it's cubby space and clean.  Well needless to say since I knew I had spilled a ton of rice down the side a few days prior when my glass bowl holding it shattered, I still had to move everything out and thoroughly clean the area.  When we did this I was beyond disgusted AND thrilled to have the new gap covers to try and keep things like this from happening again.\n\nThese arrived made of a thick quality silicone material which matched my black stove and black granite counter top.  Because my stove is so large and the space it has to fit in is barely big enough for the stove, we did have a bit of a struggle getting these into place in a way.  My husband had to tip the stove up as much as possible while I pushed the cover into place and then again on the opposite side.  They worked though perfectly and are not moving or shifting anytime soon!  I love being able to wipe the surface clean easily and it acts as a ledge of sorts too keeping spills to the top of the stove only.  For $18 these are well worth your purchase and I am thinking of scooping them up for my mother now too!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I had been shopping around for something similar not too long ago and had given up on finding one.  It never fails, the kids complain about their chicken fingers being soggy on one side or the fries we bake just aren't crunchy all the way around.  I really wasn't too sure about this one and whether or not it would truly work especially if I tried my homemade fries but I was psyched to give it a try.\n\nThe minute this arrived we decided the kids needed to have some chicken fries and tater tots for lunch over spring break to test it out.  To my surprise this actually worked.  Because the air gets all the around the food instead of the food sitting flat on a pan, the entire piece of chicken (fries, etc.) gets cooked all the way around.  I noticed an obvious difference with the first batch although the kids didn't say a thing about it.  I will say if you use a lot of seasoning or something that drips easily this does require a bit more cleaning than other pans or silicone mats but nothing that a simple dish scrubby won't solve.  I haven't had an opportunity to make my own fries yet but I am even more psyched now.

Since then I have re-read it three or four times, but unfortunately, like the first time, without a great deal of pleasure. Put bluntly I find Antonia Frasers writing style downright tedious. There can be little doubt that her research is extremely thorough, regrettably she chooses to unload every last scrap of her researches onto the page like some school student over-eager to showcase the full extent of their knowledge. This is evidently common to much of Frasers work. Recently I heard her on BBC radio, reading from her autobiography, everything she attempted to describe was lost in a welter of elaboration and qualification.  Some reviewers criticise Fraser for a  pro-Cromwell bias. Contrary to this view I find there is barely a topic covered where Fraser does not display a strong subliminal pro-Royalist agenda.

The book has a good concept: lonely wife tempted by a single dad of a child in her own kids class. So, first off, we are disliking the heroine a bit. She becomes a cheater. But beyond that, she separates from her husband and soon after, the new boyfriend is staying overnight in her home (shes still MARRIED) where her three young daughters are also sleeping. Okay, shes a bad wife, and a bad mother. I feel a little sorry for her, but then the author makes her heroine give a snide comment about drivers of hybrid vehicles. Yikes! Way to piss off the huge automobile industry!\n\nThere were quite a few holes and inconsistencies in the story. Example: first the truck had wrapped around a tree, then it was wrapped around a stop sign, and later it was mentioned it was wrapped around a tree. So was it a tree or a stop sign? In Chapter 27, there is mentioned to be candles lit everywhere, which it would need to be dark to see these, right? Right after, its mentioned His sunglasses, but it doesnt say WHAT about the sunglasses, whether they're on the face, peeking out of a pocked, or hanging at the neck. Anyway, if there are sunglasses, there is also sun, right? Well, then the lit candles are mentioned again. A professional editor would have caught and fixed these problems.\n\nThere were problems on every single page of this book.

I didn't mark all of the mistakes, but marked enough so I could make my point. If I had marked them all, I would expect to be paid as an editor. Im not a good editor, but I am a reader with a sharp eye who knows when theres been no editor at all.\n\nThe problems included the following:\n\n*Misspelled words, misuse of words, wrong homonym, and several other similar problems.\n-Mouse in his brown hair, instead of mousse\n-Her breathing became rugged, instead of ragged\n-The character Kristinas name was spelled Christina once\n-Knick in his neck, instead of crick\n-Machine beeps louder, more consistent, instead of insistent\n-Giving met support I need, instead of me the\n-Twuntwhat IS that?

Many times I lost who was saying what.\n\n*Similar problem with phone conversations. The way they were shown were the same as how texting was shown. I didn't know if it was a conversation or texting, or who was saying what.\n\n*Run-on sentences. And on. And on. And on. Run-on paragraphs?\n\n*Tense changed randomly back and forth between past and present.\n\n*Contraction useHe lets go and sits down, instead of lets.\n\nThat, by no means, is a comprehensive list, but only a taste.

So when Maryon, a member of the futureteller guild, sees Elspeth traveling to Sutrium, where the rebels are stationed, Elspeth and Rushton realize that this is the time to strike. Elspeth has another task on her hand, returning a gypsy woman to her people. Elspeth soon realizes that neither of these tasks will be solved easily.

It looks like the only way that they can be convinced is if the misfits prove themselves, a very dangerous task indeed.\nI absolutely loved this book. After The Farseekers, I didn't think that the series could get much better. I was wrong. Not only is Ashling the longest book in the series so far but it's defiantly the best. Characters that were introduced in the last two books have really grown and developed into different people completely. The most obvious is Domick, the coercer who's job at the council has turned him cold and heartless to everyone, even his own bondmate. The plot is fast paced and exciting. There is rarely a dull moment in this 450+ page wonder. Another perk is the new places that your introduced to. Not only Sutrium but in another country entirely (read the book if you want to find out). Amazing revelations are made about the beforetimers that are strikingly prophetic to our own world.

I would have preferred to see the holes for the screws countersunk so the screws sit flush with the bottom surface, and that would allow a full sheet of non-slip rubber (shelf liner) on the bottom of the base. I will probably make this modification myself, but it should have been right from the factory. This is minor and not worth taking away a star.\n\n3. With the price of this unit, it should have come with the Low Angle Adapter. You cannot sharpen a knife with a small blade, such as a classic multi-blade pocket knife without this adapter. The adapter cost ~$70. Still, I knew this in advance and I will not remove a star for it.\n\nPROS: They got a lot right. This is a well thought out machine. I believe this is the third generation.\n\n1. Set the thing on the table, grab a chair and get to work. It takes some time to get the bevel right from the hilt to the tip of the blade, but it is not hard work. Once you get finished with the 100 grit, you will progress through the others in order very quickly.\n\n2. There is a ruler that attaches to the dual pin alignment tool. Use this, so that you can record how each knife is setup. This will allow you to get repeatable results the next time you sharpen the same knife. This way, you won't have to start with the 100 grit. You will be able to just start with the higher grits and do a quick touch up. As a tip, each time I do an original sharpening on a knife, I set it in the vice with the ruler and take a good photo of it. I name the photo of the knife with the brand, model, where the tip measures on the ruler, whether I used the top or bottom hole, and what angle settings I used. I then organize these photos in a folder with the owner's name.\n\n3. The stones that the device comes with will be all that the average person will need. I seem to be doing a bunch of heavy Bowie knives and they need a lot of metal removed, so I did order the 50/80 set of stones to hog off that metal a lot faster. BUT, these are all diamond impregnated steel and they cut very aggressively. They remove a lot of metal in a hurry. These are not your grand dad's whetrock. Unlike other devices that use stones that don't stay flat, these are metal and they will remain flat and function properly for a long long time. TIP: Wipe down the blade before switching to the next finer grit. This is very important.\n\n4. Leather strops are available and I did purchase these and use them with diamond paste. For most knives, I don't need them. Only a few knives really need the show polished edge. Regular old butcher knife? No. Filet knife? Yes. Steak knives? No. Your everyday carry pocket knife? Yes. If you buy the strops, PLEASE store each one in a separate zip lock baggie. You do not want them to touch each other and contaminate the different micron diamond compounds. I cannot stress this enough. Wipe down the blade between each progression to a finer grit to keep from contaminating the compounds. The compounds imbed themselves into the leather of the strop, so if they get contaminated with a different grit, you will have to throw that strop away. These things are way too expensive to be tossing them in the trash because of user error.\n\nDANGEROUS: Use extreme caution when sharpening knives.\n\n1. If you have children, setup in an area where you can keep them out. The same goes for pets.\n\n2. You are going to be working in a moving pattern just an inch or less from the edge of a sharp blade. Be careful. Be sober. Get \"cut resistant gloves\" and use them every time. Repeat, EVERY TIME! I recommend these. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0119UBIYG?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00 They are soft, flexible, comfortable, washable, and there is no reason that you should ever sharpen knives without them.\n\n3. Don't reach over the knife that you are working on. Setup your work area so that everything can be in easy reach without having to get close to the sharp blades. Your blades will be sharp enough to cut to the bone with little to no force.\n\n4. Do not sharpen knives if you are taking medication that might make you drowsy. Do not sharpen knives if you are drinking alcohol. Do not sharpen knives if you are not in a good mood and able to completely focus on the task at hand. If you feel distracted, stop! It's just not worth the risk.\n\n5. Setup your work area with good lighting from multiple directions. Get a big (5 inch) magnifying glass to inspect the edge as you work. I use one like this. http://www.amazon.com/Carson%C2%AE-SureGrip-Acrylic-Magnifier-SG-14/dp/B0013KMW8Y/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1452291708&sr=8-6&keywords=magnifying+glass\n\nWould I buy this thing again? Absolutely! It was expensive and I had to really think about it before spending that much money, but after using it for several days and sharpening a bunch of knives of different quality, I feel like it was worth every penny. I am planning on doing some sharpening services, and also some knife restoration services, so this device will easily pay for itself. For the average person that only needs to sharpen their own knives, there are cheaper devices such as the Lansky that will fill the need. If you want to professionally sharpen blades for some extra money (like me) or as a full-time job, this is probably the best way to get consistent \"knife show quality\" results.\n\nNOTE: If you are planing to setup a permanent work area, and you can mount the vice directly to the workbench, then you can get the unit without a base and save yourself some money. If not, this stone base is very heavy and makes this unit very stable.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I have one single 3.8mm straight blade in my Telecom/Ethernet tool kit at work. I don't know where it came from but I have had it for many years. It has been hammered on. It has been grabbed with pliers to get more torque on it. It has been used as a tiny crowbar. It has been a tough little screwdriver and it is one of my prized possessions. I really expected this set to live up to the reputation of that one old TEKTON screwdriver that I had.\n\nSame Day Update: Russ from TEKTON saw this review and he has gotten with me to take care of this. I am impressed. :-)  I will update this review again after resolution.\n\nI emailed Russ a couple of photos of the offending screwdriver, the set, and the fresh packaging and he promised to make it good. He is a man of his word. Russ shipped me a new set of TEKTON screwdrivers. They arrived today and I am happy with the quality of them. Every one of them is well fitted and none are loose. Russ did right by me and now, I will return the favor. I am editing this review to show that TEKTON made good on their product.\n\nI understand that things slip by the Quality Control Department. It happens. If I had not stated here that I got a bad screwdriver, then TEKTON would not have known. They would not have had the chance to make it right. I am quite impressed that they have someone looking for reviews of these products and trying to contact dissatisfied customers. They wasted no time getting to the bottom of the problem and fixing it. That is what good customer service is all about.\n\nIf you received a bad set of these and you are not pleased with them, feel free to reply to Russ' comment on this review and give him a chance to make you happy.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 3.19}, {"id": "21805", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nSuper cool little logs!

You will not be disappointed with it if your kids are into hot wheels cars.\n\nWith that said I do have one major gripe, why did they not include another car in the package?  I mean it probably costs hotwheels Co. less than 50 cents to add another car and yet they make a track system that requires two cars for it to be useful and then give you only one!  Arggg oh well, just remember to order another car if your child does not have one available already.\n\nSo the way this track works, is that one car goes from the top tower and can trigger the launch of two more cars as it goes down the track.  Depending on how you assembled the track you can end up with different configurations of how each of the cars will exit the track and what they will do.  As I said before, you can join this into another set your child may have, so think of this track as a kind of nexus hub that can make a normal track layout much more interesting.  If you don't have another track it is still great because the layout is large and interesting on its own.  Just don't look for collisions etc. its not designed to be a smash up track but more of hub for creating interaction between multiple cars.\n\nI am sorry that I had to take off one star on this one, because it is a really good toy, but it was very frustrating on the first night when we finally got it all setup and both of us realized that another car was needed to make any of the magic happen.

Any criticism I have revolves around the Bluetooth technology. It would have been nice to hook up the phone to my computer via Bluetooth, however, the Verizon system with Samsung seem adamant to not allow this. USB cable, which you can buy from Verizon for $30 extra, however, works great and works great with a freeware software called BitPim, simply Google it and download the setup. This tool downloads/uploads everything from/to your phone: pictures, contacts, etc. I am also disappointed with most Bluetooth headphones. The ultimate test is with headphones inside a car while driving.\n\nSamsung A930 has a lot of community support. The most impressive web site I found is ([...]). The discussion thread talks about secret menus, etc. Also more useful topics about Bluetooth, voice memo, camera usage among other things.\n\nThe camera, by the way, aside from taking snapshots and video stream, has a flash for taking better pictures.\n\nBecause of this camera's versatility and price, I bought another one for my wife.

This is my 2nd occasion to spend time with characters in the Whiskey Creek Series following my first introduction to Whiskey Creek by reading Take Me Home for Christmas.  As I read the last page I wanted to get in my vehicle and drive to Whiskey Creek so I could spend more time with all of the characters but particularly with Presley Christensen.\n\nThe story begins as Presley (or Pres for short) has moved back to Whiskey Creek with her infant son Wyatt after a 2-year absence.  On the professional side of life, Presley is opening her own business and has all the excitement and uncertainties of a new entrepreneur.  There are questions on the personal side of life as well.  Is Presley ready for a new relationship  not only the first relationship since the birth of her son but the first relationship since she has made significant changes in her life or as the woman she is now in comparison to the girl she used to be.  But the primary question that continues to haunt the outcome of Presleys future  Will the paternity of her son Wyatt be revealed?\n\nI mentioned this comment in an earlier Brenda Novak book review but it definitely deserves mention again.  One of the special delights of the Whiskey Creek Series is that each novel can be enjoyed as a stand-alone title.  There are some novels that are tiring to read as in order to move the current story forward, the author seems to provide a comprehensive review of the attributes and histories of all characters to date which interrupts the flow of the current novel and is more of a frustrating and distracting interruption to the reader  regardless if an independent title reader or series reader.  With each Brenda Novak novel, the story is fluid and the past is presented as gracefully as the oceans tide coming up to the beach shoreline and going back out as the rhythm of life continues forward.  And with that same ease and grace, the author shares one of the most noteworthy aspects of life that the course of each day leaves an imprint on our hearts and in our minds affecting each path forward of our life journey just as the ocean water leaves a residual imprint on the beach, however delicate and calm or stormy and forceful  each days tide affects the future.  With each conversation, with each interaction, with each learning opportunity and life experience, an individual has the opportunity to grow not only in terms of age by birthday celebrations but in the complexities of composition of their own maturity, values, and what each holds most dear in their personal and professional lives.\n\nCome Home to Me is a beautiful and thoughtful glimpse of a very special time in Presleys life, a life-changing moment in time for Presleys sister Cheyenne, and a time of multiple decisions for the Amos brothers.  The novel is a thoughtful rendition to all that your attitude and your choices equal your life.  I do not present spoilers in any of my book reviews but I promise you will be intrigued by the multiple cliffhangers that arise during your reading time of Come Home to Me.  Enjoy!\n\nI was lucky enough to receive a pre-publication copy of this title from the author to read and review.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It tells the story of a woman aptly named Phoenix Fuller and a man named Riley Stinson. As I began reading, I've never wanted to read a book so quickly and yet so slowly. This novel is compelling and intense reading to the core of one's heart - especially if the reader has ever had to heal from heartache and \"start over\" or \"begin again\". Heartache can take many forms - it knows no boundaries - it crosses lines of gender and socio-economic class without definition and the timing is often unexpected. Anyone that hopes or wonders about second chances in life and especially second chances for love might want to begin their path forward by reading this novel.\n\nI have read many of the novels in the Whiskey Creek Series and each time I've burrowed into the story, I ponder and muse that \"this one\" is my favorite. Then as a new novel in the series becomes available and I read the story, I change my mind and want to exclaim \"this one\" as my favorite. So until a new title is released, I share \"this one\" to savor, to hold dear to your heart, to delve in deeply to the vulnerabilities of the characters, to experience the courageous search for a path forward, to understand the depth of the love of a child, to cheer for perseverance, and to hope that love can be as resilient as it is in our hopes and dreams.\n\nAs with every novel in the Whiskey Creek series, there are characters from previous novels and once again the reader is enveloped in the strength of their mutual respect for one another, their genuine caring, and the depth of their friendships in good times and in sorrow. Without a doubt, Whiskey Creek is a special place where courage becomes stronger, perseverance and hard work build character, and life becomes richer with the blessings of friendship and love. I highly recommend a visit - you'll not be disappointed no matter the story you choose to begin reading.\n\nI mentioned this comment in an earlier book review for the Whiskey Creek Series but it definitely deserves mention again.

I bought two more of his books, and just finished The Perk, probably one of the most emotionally satisfying books I have ever read.

But this story captured my imagination (I'm retired law enforcement) and I didn't want it to end. But I felt VERY satisfied at the end.

While following the timeline of Ravensbruck from its foundation in 1939 through its many stages during the war years, we get to know about the officers and guards running it, the different populations of women incarcerated there, the introduction of slave labor, medical experiments, the transports for killing, and efforts to get the word out and organize rescue missions.\n\nIn telling the complicated story of the camp, we get to learn about dozens of memorable women prisoners: how they coped and survived; how they helped each other; how they died or what happened to survivors after the war. Helm also discusses why the camp at Ravensbruck has been overlooked by scholars. This book helps to redress that lack of attention.

It painstakingly documents their movements behind the lines and their fates in the last years of the war. In the process, it slowly reveals the mysterious character of Vera Atkins, a Romanian-born Jew and, technically, an enemy alien, who recruited and trained women agents for the French section of Britain's Strategic Operations Executive.\n\n\"A Life in Secrets\" is a great piece of investigative journalism and far more exciting (and heartbreaking) than any fictional spy novel I've read. Each chapter takes you deeper into the layers of personal danger and bureaucratic intrigue. Leads seem to take the story in one direction, only for it to be derailed or redirected elsewhere. Just when you think you know what has happened, more information is discovered that puts a different spin on things. Throughout the book, the heroism and sacrifice of the agents makes you ache for answers about their fates. And you root for Vera Atkins' persistent efforts to account for and honor her missing agents.\n\nI agree with everyone here who has praised Sarah Helm's outstanding research and writing. The number of people she interviewed, the extensive war documents she quotes, and the multiple verifications she obtained to confirm information result in an extraordinary achievement. This book is so layered. It's not only an important history of Britain's spy network in France, it's a major biography of the mysterious Vera Atkins. It includes dozens of shorter biographies of secret agents, military officers, concentration camp survivors, SS officers and prison guards. There's perspective on the deteriorating circumstances of the Jewish community in Romania and Hungary in the 1930s and lots of information on the war crimes prosecutions in 1945-47.\n\nMy only warning to readers is to be patient and really take the time to carefully read this book. The large numbers of people, places and times can be daunting to keep track of but your patience will be rewarded. I've read it twice to fully appreciate it. The Anchor Books edition includes a map and list of characters at the beginning which are helpful references.

When a friend lent me a copy of this book, I had to buy myself one. This is such a terrific addition to literature and I am so enlightened to have read it. I read Codependent No More over and over with a 1980s copy, and I never would have guessed what Ms. Beattie went through to get where she's at today. Prostitution so she could get drugs, rape from drugged stupors, her arm being photographed with all its needle marks and used to show school children the horrors of drug use -- the clinicians certainly never thought she'd amount to anything, but she learned codependency is the root of all addiction.\nA wonderful read. It will make you cry! It did me. A lot of people, men and women, will see themselves in her story. It really makes a person appreciate how she knows so much about codependency and is such an authority. Personal experience, that's what she has to share. I love her meditation books, too. Such an inspiration and used in Codependents Anonymous meetings everywhere. Her books should be a must-read for high school students. She can help people before it's too late.\nHer humor in the book is especially wonderful because with all she went through, it makes one wonder what she could find to laugh about, and her humor just further brings home what an astounding woman Ms. Beattie is!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I was originally very excited. Packaging was fantastic, it came with this postcard sized \"personal\" guarantee and assurance of quality and customer service. The two rear ruby lights were very bright especially if you look right at them dead on, in what I call \"the sweet spot\". The front torch is actually slightly less bright than I hoped it would be given it's advertised lumens, but decent enough. Sadly, due to some really absent minded behaviour from me. I lost the front torch and the two USB batteries. I have since bought the following bicycle light set :\n\nBright Eyes 300 Lumen 2-pack LED Bicycle Headlight - Includes Second Set For FREE - Mounts in Seconds With No Tools Required - LIFETIME WARRANTY\n\nI believe it has better value in that it is only two thirds the prices, yet you get 4, not 3, lights. I have written a review for that set too.\n\nHowever, this is a review about the Magnus light set, so let's go.\n\nThe Good:\n========\n\n- Although I think the set is overpriced, there's no denying that it works and is attractive. And if you haven't seen those push button type ruby lights before, you'll just gaze into them, mesmerised, thinking it looks so cool.\n\n- But the best thing about it are the USB batteries. I have neveer seen such batteries before, and can't find any mention of anyone selling them individually, which is a darn pity because they are very practical. Before I lost the torch, I took it and both USB 18650 batteries overseas for a couple of nights hikes. I had my USB charger with me, and it was nice to not have to bring extra cables, or the boxy battery charger in addition to the USB charger.\n\nWait, you ask...what the heck is a \"USB\" battery? Batteries can't plug into USB slots, right?\n\nWell, it seems yes they can, but only with the special Magnus design. Here's how it works. See the picture with the front torch on it's holder, the two red lights and two batteries standing upright? About 20% down from the top of the battery is a silver/chrome horizontal ring around it. At first glance, this looks decorative. But in fact it's not. You see the ring because that's where the main battery body and the cap/lid meet. That's right, the top 1cm actually comes off, revealing the battery cylinder and a USB male part socket. But wait!, you say. The top of the battery looks like a real battery...that's where it touches the torch inside the battery compartment. Yes indeed, that is exactly what it looks like and is. But it's still part of the lid.\n\nNow, there's a trick to taking off the top. The lid is actually attached to a thin piece of string, to hold the lid to the battery. The lid fits quite snugly to the battery, so you might apply a bit of brute force, like a certain macho man, whom we shall call \"A\", and finally rip the lid off, but at the same time, break the string. With the benefit of experience (which means I screwed up in the past), I avoided breaking the string in the second one.\n\nWOW! you exclaim. That's amazing. Yes it is, but there's more! When you lplug in the battery to the USB port, a LED light next to the USB male part socket lights up. It's been too long for me to remember which is which, but when it's not fully charged, it's one colour, and when fully charged, it's another.  Pretty cool, right?\n\nSo I think the best part of this set are the batteries. Really wish I hadn't lost them.\n\n- The lights are quite decent, cars should notice you easily. The torch holder rotates so it's flexible\n\n- Everything attaches quite easily to the bike.\n\nThings to be aware of :\n=================\n\n- See above for USB battery lids and the strings\n- The lanyard attached to the end of the torch makes it slightly inconvenient to slide the torch into the holder. You have to pull the lanyard through first. Minor but if you don't, it'll jam in the torch holder hole.\n- The lanyard doesn't have a sliding ...\"thing\" in it, which allows you to tighen it against your wrist so if you use the torch as a torch and hold it in your hand, it has less chance to slip off.\n\nThat's all I can remember. I suspect the price is more a reflection of the USB batteries than the lights' price. If you have the money, you might want to consider buying TWO sets. Why? Because the more lights on your bicycle, the safer you will be (cars have huge lights to prevent 1500kg metal projectiles from hitting them- why shouldn't you? The only physical defence a bicycle has are airbags, but without the \"bag\" part.) and you will get 4 of those batteries. I know I know...it's a lot of money. But I love their batteries! It's only a suggestion people.

I bought a 2000 lumen one which burnt through batteries in 10 minutes, several white smaller ones (you can see them in Amazon as ruby red round ones) which are great for getting people to notice you, but pretty poor for lighting up the road, and another 300 lumen torch, which I lost just prior to a bicycle tour!  So after a search through amazon, I bought this set of lights based on the price and how many lights they include in the pack. Overall it is quite good, but not perfect.\n\nThe Good:\n--------------\n\n- Price - 4 lights for about USD$40. Don't often see a waterproof light fornt or rear for USD$10. Good value. Certainly can do worse.\n\n- You get 4 lights. For night cycling, the more lights the better. The lights have 2 aims....to make sure cars and see you and not hit/kill/cripple you, and to see the road ahead. I've never understood why people use a single tiny dull light on each end of the bike. Cars have huge lights to avoid being hit by 1500kg hunks of metal. Why shouldn't you? I've put a light on my wheel spokes too for side visiblity. 300 lumens is the minimum for good illumination to see the road in front of you on a dark road.\n\n- Quality. The front and rear lights are well made and waterproof. The front light holders seem quite cheap..or at least lack refinement. Screws were rusty at box opening. Other reviewers have noticed this as well. Lanyards on torches are ok, but one with a sliding piece which can tighten around the wrist would be better. I will be using these torches for hiking at night too.\n\n- Rear lights have several settings and the silicone is opaque so light can be seen in all directions. not just the back. TOrches only shine light at the front.\n\n- Presentation counts. The box is attractive, no manual inside though. All lights firmly held in place in their foam insets.\n\nLess Good:\n---------------\n\n- the rear lights only have a single clip. It cannot be adjusted for wrapping around thinner parts of the bike. So if you have a bike rack which attaches to the seat post, or a normal rack but carrying a load, then the light can't be attached, or can't be seen.\n\n- the front torch holders do the job, but do not allow rotation. I like to turn my lights a little to the side so I can spread the light wider, and so cars on the side have a better chance of seeing me.\n\nOverall it's a decent buy for some reasonable bicycle lights.

Anyone who hears the stories of Quetzecoatl and a few others can see that it is possible, even likely that travelers have visited Earth in the past. The modern question of aliens is not a subject covered here, nor should it be.\n\nThis book is basically an investigation of esoteric myth and science combined with a modern understanding of physics. To see if they converge at all. And they do, fantastically.\n\nThe place to really start though is not here. After reading the book: \"SS: Brotherhood of the Bell\" by the same author, I was convinced that Dr. Farrell is doing his homework. That subject I am very familiar with, which enabled me to verify and trust the author's work. In that book, he kept referring to the Giza Death Star Series and Reich of the Black Sun, which I had to read because SS Brotherhood was so awesome. I was not disappointed.\n\nAfter reading and thoroughly enjoying SS: Brotherhood of the Bell, I read and really took seriously the Giza Death Star books (3 of them). I have become convinced through this author's arguments that something took place in our solar sytem long, long ago. That the pyramids represent proof of a highly advanced form of physics involved with their technological purpose: weaponry.\n\nIt is far-fetched, but actually pretty reasonable if you read the arguments and try to understand the science.\n\nThis book follows the Giza Death Star books and may not be the best place to start, unless your already at a place where this stuff seems reasonable. Then by all means. Either way, don't pass it up.

An M-60 machine gun fires 7.62 NATO rounds.  Not 50 caliber.  A revolver used by police does not have a safety.  Your booger digit is the safety.  A Barret rifle is not greater than 50 caliber.\n\nNow all of that might not be a big deal.  And, in most fiction, it isn't that big of a deal.  Just a pet peeve.  However, when the novel is exhaustively researched as this novel was purported to be, these obvious errors cast some doubt on the research and how \"exhaustive\" it might have been.  I'd also go along with a number of other reviewers who state the Spanish 'vernacular' used throughout the novel is misspelled, fails idiomatically and is poor syntactically.  It looks more like Google Translate than real Spanish.  How hard would it have been to find a Latino to proof these sentences?\n\nNow, the good stuff.  I thoroughly enjoyed the novel.  A number of events are taken from real life and are portrayed effectively.  The role of the CIA in Central America and their use of the drug trade for financing and wet work is realistic.  Most Americans are only familiar with Iran-Contra.  It went deeper than that and continues to effect our lives on a daily basis.  The War on Drugs has been a fraud on the citizens of this country for a very long time.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a great read for someone who is interested in history of the period.  It certainly will revise one's thinking about American Exceptionalism.  As I closed the book, I had a song running around in my head....Bruce Cockburn's \"If I had a Rocket Launcher\".

I had a list of criteria that the player had to meet:\n\n-EXCELLENT SOUND.  This is critical.  A SnR (Signal to Noise Ratio) of 95db or better\n\n-Excellent battery life.  At least 15 hours\n\n-At least 20 GB\n\n-A color screen\n\n-Sturdy build\n\n-As little touch-sensitive controlling as possible.  Click wheels are inaccurate and bothersome.\n\n-Ease of use.  Drag and drop is preferred.\n\n-AC adapter for charging on the road or from an AC converter in a car\n\nThis player meets all of those needs.  The SnR is 97db, I've gotten 18 hours out of the battery (remember that increased settings like equalizers and higher bitrates mean lower battery life for ALL players), the case is solid and brushed aluminum, the screen is pretty and quite sharp, only one touch-sensitive control is present, the player CAN drag and drop through Win XP, and it comes with a wall adapter.\n\nI love the powerful sound this puts out and it can drive my big headphones with no problem.  It can, like most HDD players, set aside a partition for storage.  It has a good FM tuner, recording of FM and a little mic for voice notes.  It can even sync with Outlook for contacts and other info.  The hard disk seems fast and\n\nNow for the drawbacks:\n\n-You can't watch 15fps video on a tiny screen and reduce your battery life by 67%\n\n-The USB cable is proprietary...no mini USB!\n\n-The wall charger cable plugs into the USB cable...this means two cables for recharging from the wall\n\n-Looking at photos and playing music at the same time is not possible\n\n-Creative software is always iffy.  Thankfully, in Win XP, you can open the player from My Computer and access its contents directly with non-DRM music and photos.\n\n-Battery is NON-USER REPLACEABLE.  This is odd for Creative.\n\n-No mention of this on the Creative website.  Thankfully, updated drivers ARE available from support.\n\nThis player would have been state-of-the-art about a year ago, but has been eclipsed by its bigger brother the Zen Vision with 30 and 60GB drives and video...however, if you're not buying into the \"kill your eyes with tiny video on tiny screens\" and just want a SOLID and RELIABLE player with booming sound, this is it!!!  You can tell it's custom-made for Windows (it's MTP, not UMS for any computer), but if you're running XP, then it's a solid choice because you can skip the Creative software and just load music on it.\n\nIf you can get it on sale like I did, snatch it up.

There are so many different sized accessory pockets on these shorts that he has plenty to choose from, and will never go lacking.

Although it is easy to operate, it has a huge array of features.\n\nThe Tecsun PL-880 is easily the best and most expensive of the small Tecsun radios. See Picture of Tecsun Radios.\n\nSOUND\nBy using a better 450mW audio amplifier (thanks, Dan) and an improved 3 watt mylar speaker, the PL-880 has the best sound of these radios. High frequencies are crisp and clear, low frequencies are audible, and the midrange is exceptionally clear. FM Stereo is available through the headphone jack.\n\nPOWER\nThe unit is powered by a 5V USB port or a rechargeable, replaceable 18650 lithium battery. This is a huge deal. With heavy use and the back-light on, the factory-supplied 2000mAh battery lasts me about 15 days. When it does discharge, I can just recharge it in the radio, or swap it out with another inexpensive, long lasting 18650 battery. I just swapped out my 2000mAh 18650 with a 5000mAh 18650. Note that this is better than using AA batteries to get 4.8 volts, because the amperage isn't cumulative. If you use 4 AA batteries that are rated at 1600 mAh at 1.2v to get the required 4.8 volts, you still only have 1600 mAh, just at 4.8 volts.\n\nBACK-LIGHTING\nBecause of the long-lasting battery, the back-light of the display can be turned on indefinitely. Alternatively, you can choose to have it only stay on for a few seconds (after you touch a knob or button), or just turn it completely off. A long press on \"5\" when the radio is off, toggles the light's behavior. Likewise, you can use a switch on the side.\n\nTUNING\nTuning for all bands is easily accomplished with separate main tuning and fine tuning knobs. This is a great arrangement, far better than the auto switching tuning speed of the PL-660. Frequencies can be directly entered through the key pad. In addition, you can scan to the next/previous station with a long press to the SCAN button. Direction of scan depends on whether you were last manually tuning up or down.\n\nMEMORIES\nThere are 100-250 memories per page per band (FM, AM, LW, SW, SSB), and there are 25 pages (0-24). Since many stations are only available for a limited time, I use each page (0-23) to group broadcasts available at that hour. An auto sort function will sort memories by band and frequencies, eliminating duplicates. Auto Tuning Storage (ATS) will automatically find and remember all stations available for a single band, or search all bands.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nMany other convenience features include a sleep timer, an alarm clock, 8 band widths, direct keypad entry, simple tone control, line-out for recording, a headphone jack, an internal ferrite bar AM antenna, and an external antenna jack.\n\nIn addition to the many features listed in the \"Operation Manual\", techies are delighted to find many more hidden features like Synchronous Detection, Dynamic Noise Reduction, Muting Threshold, Line Output Level, Calibration of SSB, Antenna Source, Firmware Version Display and date, \"up\" time, and charge time. Accessories include an Operation Manual, a lithium rechargeable battery, a long wire external antenna, a wall charger, and a very nice leatherette case. The knobs turn very smoothly with a nice damped motion and ergonomic placement.\n\nINTERNATIONAL BROADCAST BANDS\nIf you follow the reception hints below, you'll find interesting stations like Austria, Australia, Cameroon, Deutsche Vella, Greece, Japan, Radio Marti, Quebec, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey, Tirana, Vietnam, etc. You can find these broadcasts in the vicinity of 2300-2495, 3200-3400, 3900-4000, 4750-5060, 5900-6200, 7200-7450, 9400-9900, 11600-12100, 13570-13870, 15100-15800, 17480-17900, 21450-21850 and 25600-26100. When you key in any of these frequencies, the PL-880 will tell you the meter band.\n\nAM\nYou can use this radio for DX (distant) reception of AM stations that will surprise you. Get outside. You might even try an external AM antenna like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kaito-AN-200-Tunable-Passive-AM-Antenna-for-AM-radio-Any-Brands-Like-Kaito-Sony-Eton-Panasonic-Tecsun-Grundig-Etc/dp/B001PNNXGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kaito AN-200 Tunable Passive AM Antenna for AM radio, Any Brands, Like Kaito,Sony,Eton,Panasonic,Tecsun,Grundig Etc.</a>. Inexpensive and great fun.\n\nSINGLE SIDE BAND\nSingle Side Band (SSB) is where the ham broadcaster uses only half (lower or upper) the channel that he would otherwise use. This allows more broadcasters in the same vicinity but sounds garbled without the proper decoder. This radio will allow you to understand them by choosing either the upper or lower side band (USB/LSB). You can then fine tune the broadcast with the fine tuning knob and reduce noise by choosing the best of 5 alternative band widths (4, 3, 2.3, 1.2 and 0.5 kHz) especially chosen for SSB mode. Most digital radios (including this one) are callibrated to the nearest khz. However the PL-880 will display hundreths of a khz on SSB, and you can easily calibrate it so the that ham band SSB transmissions are dead on. Say that most transmissions sound clearest at 0.15 above the khz, for example 7060.15 on LSB. All you have to do is fine-tune it for the clearest sound and hold down the \"Snooze\" button for a few seconds. The .15 will turn to .00 and your radio will be calibrated to the \"zero beat\" for virtually all LSB stations.  You can repeat for the USB and your SSB stations will be easily tuned and clear. Typically, the Lower Side Band is used below 10MHz and the Upper Side Band is used above 10MHz. Ham Radio is very popular. You can find these amateur broadcasts in the vicinity of 1843-2000, 3790-3800, 3885, 7290 and 14286 kHz.\n\nRECEPTION HINTS\nJust tuning randomly may not be rewarding.\no Get a phone app for Short Wave Listening like SWBC, or use your browser to find Shortwave Listening guides.\no Search for particular stations on their own frequencies and recommended times.\no Get away from electrical interference like your computer or USB charger.\no Try the long-wire antenna outside. Better still, make a simple dipole antenna by stretching some 18 AWG wire in opposite directions and connect one end to the Left terminal of a 3.5mm connector, connect the other wire to the GND connector. A solderless connector makes it easy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BCP-5pcs-3-5mm-1-8inches-Stereo-Audio-Male-to-AV-3-Screw-Terminal-Female-Connector/dp/B016W9P4N0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BCP 5pcs 3.5mm (1/8inches) Stereo Audio Male to AV 3-Screw Terminal Female Connector</a>&nbsp;See picture, below.\no Reception is better in the evening and at night.

Instead, this radio has 3 position switch for Local, Normal, or DX reception.\no The sync detector is poor, hardly ever improving the reception.\no You must send the radio to Kaito to get a free firmware update; you cannot do it yourself.\no The frequencies and mode are memorized, but you cannot add text.\no FM sounds great in mono or stereo, but there is no RDS (Radio Data Service), or HD radio.\no The display back-lighting is great, but does not illuminate the keys.\no Unlike more expensive radios, you cannot control this radio with your computer.\no All but the most recent samples with firmware version 8820 have the minor, but annoying \"Fine Tuning Bug\". Within a khz, the fine tuning will tune (but not display) backwards while tuning SSB. Just because the radio has version 8820 of the firmware, doesn't mean this bug is fixed. Check with the vendor or Kaito if you are concerned. My radio does not have this bug.\n\nFOR THE SAME MONEY\nIf you listen to distant AM stations or Shortwave, the PL880 is well worth the money, currently rated 4.6/5 by Amazon buyers.

This new book continues his upward curve. Reminiscent of an 80's B-flick, we have the typical group of young adults on an weekend away. Initially, I felt that half of the group were completely unnecessary. They were all pretty unlikeable, with no obvious endearing qualities. I couldn't understand how certain members of the group even had any friends. I quickly realised that each one of the six were vital to the progression of the tale, even if the reader is not exactly rooting for any of them.\n\nSkinner has all the elements of a creepy, claustrophobic tale of survival. What sets it aside from the usual teen-slasher stories set in the woods is that the villain is not a masked axeman or even one of their own group, as is usually the case. We have a very unique supernatural force at work in this story, which means that we have no idea how events will play out.\n\nThe ending was satisfying, if slightly predictable. It appears to have been left open for a sequel. I, for one, would welcome a continuation of this story. Skinner is a thoroughly enjoyable book; entertaining, horrific and engrossing. This could have come straight out of the twisted mind of Richard Laymon.

Nonetheless, what has amazed me from the start (and I began to counsel women and men way back in 1991) is that so many authors, in particular males, write about men who commit adultery and who are involved in sexual sins, such as sex addiction. I've counseled both sexes and have found women have just as big a problem as do men in both arenas. And boy did that astonish me, particularly being a new Christian back in 1991. Then, I had thought being a Christian you would have all your ducks in a row and be in complete obedience to Christ. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine \"Christian women\" cheating on their marriage and having sexual addictions. I had them on a pedestal, both women and men. Sadly, this author like many others seems to view only men with a problem such as sex addiction and that is disappointing. Whether I use the Bible or not, and I do, I would still counsel women differently than men, so it would have been good had there been more info on women as sex addicts. For starters, the author could change the cover and show both women and men on it, shock the rest of the Church along with my earlier shock. Heck, his book sales may skyrocket.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I wasn't sure what I was getting when I received the box - it was obvious I would need to assemble the light.  What I found was an easy to assemble light that works very well.  Putting the light together is not only intuitive (in my opinion) but also includes easy to follow instructions.  Ive found that with many products, the instructions included aren't always clear or easy to follow.  I was happy with these, and could have assembled this light easily without the instructions.  Everything went together easily and without additional tools.  I appreciate how easy they made it to connect the wiring.\n\nThe light itself was brighter than I expected - and dimmable (by holding the power button down until you get to desired brightness) - which was a bonus.  An added bonus to that is that the light remembers the brightness it was at when you last used it - so once you get the perfect amount of light, you don't have to change it every time you turn the light back on.  I don't believe this light isn't really intended to light a room, but is excellent at focused light for reading or projects.  However, because you can change the direction/angle of the light, you can use it in more ways than youd first think.  As an added convenience, the on/off switch is lit so you can find it in the dark.\n\nThe base of the lamp is heavy enough to adequately keep the light upright and without threat of tipping.  Because the bulbs are LED, they don't get hot - which means you don't have to worry about little fingers or that there is any fire hazard from anything sitting too close to the light bulbs.\n\nOverall, I really like this light and think it will be handy in several different situations.  If there were anything Id suggest for improving it, Id probably go with the plastic sleeve on the bendable neck.  It seems a little bulkier than necessary and doesnt look quite as polished as the rest of the lamp.  This has no effect on the usability or utility of the light and is more of an aesthetic thing for me.  As a whole, the light is simple and understated, with a more modern look.  Would be great at a desk/worktable and an excellent light for a kids space - easy to use, easy to direct, and no hot bulbs to burn fingers on.  Not to mention, eats little power when left on (as kids are notorious for doing!).\n\nI purchased this light at a discounted price, however, my review is based on my experience with the product.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Once I finish, I forget that I needed better light there until later.  So when I was offered the chance to try this light out at a discounted price in order to test and review it, I had all kinds of ideas about where to use it.\n\nFirst, some of the reviews I've read have knocked this light because they feel it's not very bright - but in my opinion, this light isn't built to light very large spaces, and I don't think it's described as being able to do that.  Second, I've seen some complaints that it doesn't sense as far as described - and I did find the same thing in some situations.  When coming straight on at the light, I do have the light come around 9ft, probably most reliably at a little closer.  However, when coming from the side, I didn't have quite as good results.\n\nBecause of that, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, however, for how we use the light, we'd give it 5 stars.  We have this in our \"tech nook\" which is a ~2'x4' recessed space in our laundry room that holds our routers, audio receiver, DirecTV box, etc.  Because this is at the back of the room and goes off to the side, it never has enough light.  We have wired shelves in this space and so put this little light directly above the space with all the wiring and connections, so whenever we have to come in to reset the router, check a connection or whatever, and reach into the space, the light comes on.  Perfect!  The attached photos show the light on while the rest of the room is completely dark.  Pay no attention to our messy wiring.  And dust...\n\nI can also see uses for this in many other places - we have a corner cabinet that we're pretty sure has a secret space in the back that we've never seen.  This little light would be perfect in there.  I also tried this as an under the vanity (toe kick area) light - when you walk past it, the light comes on, bright enough to light up the space, but not so bright you are blinded.  I almost forgot to mention that this light comes with a magnetic strip that attaches to the back of the light.  This strip has adhesive on the back side, so you can place the strip anywhere you like, then attach the actual light magnetically to the strip.  This is nice for two reasons - one, it makes it really easy to change batteries without having to take screws out or try to do it with it mounted.  The second, it also makes this little light a handy flashlight if you find that you need some light in a different spot.\n\nOverall, I am really pleased with this light - I really want to give it 5 stars, but because I do see that there could be some conflict in the range of the sensor and this could be important to some people, I feel like I should give it 4.  If I buy others and use them in different applications and find that the range is further than I have realized with this particular one, I'll update my review very happily.\n\nAs I mentioned, I did receive this at a discounted price, but I try to review any item as if I bought it at full price.  I use Amazon reviews extensively for my own purchases and want to do my part to keep them as pure as possible.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.16}, {"id": "21866", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nFirst of all, a disclaimer: this is not my usual genre of reading material. I much prefer historical novels, detective stories, thrillers and general fiction, but I purchased the first boxed set on a Kindle special for $2.99 and got hooked on the stories. I'm very glad I chose to borrow the subsequent books from the library. 74 Seaside Avenue is the worst one I have read so far, but I will probably read the next one, because I am curious about one of the subplots. Part of my problem with this installment comes with some of the unrealistic assumptions of the series, chiefly that love conquers all. All you have to do is be \"in love\" and everything will work out, regardless of the backgrounds of the two people that fate has thrown together. The absurd pairing of Terri the beautician and her world champion chess player husband strains credulity, and the threat from unnamed Russian mobsters trying to throw a chess match doesn't really fit with the rest of the series.\n\nAlso, I don't know if it is because of the religious sensibilities of the author, but all of the adult characters, even if they have been married before, seem to have unrealistically chaste courtships. I find it hard to believe that a widow or widower who falls in love again after a long marriage would be satisfied with thrilling kisses. The only people who seem to have premarital sex are young, and they always seem to get pregnant for their moment of passion (even if it was only once). Then the father, after some predictable plot turns, always does the right thing and marries the mother and they live (mostly) happily ever after. Again, maybe I just don't like this genre of fiction, but I've found the stories interesting, if unrealistic.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The first two were pretty good, but I found the third one, which took place in a hospital and hospice setting, to be predictable and contrived.  I didn't particularly relish Alton's \"protector\" status relative to Mallory, which was reiterated throughout the stories over and over, nor did I feel that the idea of saving themselves for marriage added anything to the relationships or the stories It could have been omitted altogether, keeping the reader guessing. Unless the author was trying to appeal to a \"family values\" readership, it didn't add anything to the plot, and came across as contrived and irrelevant.

Ms. Lavati has written a book that has very strong characters and it is well paced. I love it when you can tell that the author researched and created this story methodically. The details and build up were perfectly written. I was completely entertained and engrossed in this book and did not want to stop reading. I laughed, cried and screamed throughout this book, the struggles of these 3 characters are heart felt and believable.\n\nMaggie is a character that I was so proud and inspired by. She and her 9 year old bother, Asher lost both their parents in a car accident. Maggie did not want to lose her brother so she stepped up to the plate to become his guardian. Let me explain my love for this young woman, it cannot be easy to be a sister one day and become a mother the next.  She puts his needs before herself, takes care of him and makes sure he has a stable, strong and loving environment. She has times when she feels that she is not good at parenting but she never gives up and rises to the occasion. It is not easy for a young woman to take care of a young boy, the house, bills and herself but she never once complained. Asher was her life. Maggie no longer dates, her main goal is Asher and giving him a better life. Let me say it is not easy for her especially when she has a crazy grandma on her back, constantly trying to tear her down.\n\nLuke's character at first comes off as conceded and cocky, but that changes. He recently become the PE teacher at Ashers school and is his teacher. Luke is also attending college and has a class with Maggie. As soon as they meet Luke sees something in Maggie that he wants. Lukes character is nothing at all what I thought. Luke and his siblings live in a very violent home, he wants to protect them from their abusive fathers so instead of being on his own he stays home. I found that such an admirable and selfless quality. Luke has so many inner issues. He and his siblings have an amazing relationship, they support each other and help out when they need it.\n\nLukes and Maggies relationship is a slow build up. Maggie is very cautious with her heart and what man will enter Ashers life. Luke was relentless, he sees Maggie as a strong, funny and independent beautiful woman and wants to be a part of her and Ashers life. For me the friendship and build up made me fall in love with them as a couple. It did not feel rushed or forced, it just felt natural. I really loved Lukes relationship and connection with Asher.\n\nFor the Love of Ash is not your classic romance novel, it is much more. The book deals with issues such as child abuse, anger management, how to become a parent when you are young yourself, how to deal with the loss of parents and how much a person can and will sacrifice for love and family. Real life issues affect them and they have to find a way to navigate through them al. We all know how life has its way of surprising you. The books most redeeming points for me was the development of these great characters and how they genuinely matured and adjusted throughout the book.

While I was reading this book I lost myself in Addies journey. The author did an amazing job with the development of the characters. Depression and suicide ideation isn't an easy subject matter to write about but the author did an amazing job on it. I felt the authenticity and struggle these characters had through her words. I loved that the story also provided resources for anyone seeking help. Wash Me Away is told in First person and is told through Addies POV. While this books deals with serious issues, it also gives us a remarkable story on how these issues can be overcome and life can become enjoyable again.\n\nAddie is living with her Aunt Jane and Uncle Gil after losing her father in a storm. Addies life is not at all what her aunt and uncle thought. She has never spoken to anyone about her life with her father Thomas. Just before she is scheduled to start school at Burton Academy, her aunt and uncle want her to speak to a counselor about her feelings. Unbeknownst to Addie, she befriends Leo who also attends the Academy. Addie is not used to having friends but on her first day she becomes friends with not only Leo but Julia and Miyagi. The four become very close and establish an easy and natural friendship. They help Addie focus on her new life rather than her past life. Of course I helps that Leo is around, even though he has a girlfriend.\n\nAddies character is one that I loved. Even though she was damaged by her past we see her grow throughout the story. It is not easy for her to see her friends have loving parents when she lost her mother and a young age, and life with her father was nothing like people thought. At her new home Addie finds letters from her mother and she begins to learn the truth about her family. I loved the eagerness and focus Addie takes when she reads these letters. Just when she starts to get comfortable tragedy strikes the group of friends. Miyagis sister, Willow commits suicide. They are all having a hard time dealing with it, but the reasons for her suicide leaves Julia and Addie confused. Addie starts to see that Willow and her have more in common that she thought. Addie learns of a family secret that changes her already shattered existence.\n\nWe do not get Leos POV but you can see how special Addie is to him. Even though he has a girlfriend, there was no doubt for me on where his heart and head are really focused. The connection and chemistry between these characters is strong\n\nYou know you're not like most girls.\nFrom this angle, it appears Im like most of the girls Ive met.\nI don't mean like that. God not, you're beautiful. What I mean is you're different because you are easy to talk to.\n\nAddie will have to find a way to accept the truth which can very well be the last straw to her already fragile mind. The things this poor girl has endured and lived through will break your heart. I loved the way the author wrote this entire story and how well the characters were woven in perfectly. Each of the friends are dealing with issues of their own and I loved how their strange friendships helped them to deal with the realities of their own lives. I loved how they find solace and peace together. Addie and her friends journey is one youll want to get on and one you will not regret.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.37}, {"id": "21876", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI like this powder very much.

I was impressed with the premise of time travel, and what they did with a likely low budget.  Wow, I was impressed with how they made those likely new cars look so grundged with dirt and dust, very impressive.  The story seemed passable for a sci fi movie, and the affects of someone disappearing were stunning for a movie I've never heard of before.

Each day is a couple verses from the Bible, a paragraph of commentary, and places to write your reflections or journal your journey. When battling burnout, depression, or the myriad of other pains that come our way, sometimes a 3-5 page chapter is just a bit too much. God's Word is effective, and I appreciate the humility that comes from the author's experiences of having a \"little less of me and a lot more of God.\"\n\nAlso the selections of scriptures were well done. So glad is wasn't your typical, \"I can do all things through Christ...\" motivational message. She touches on the need for rest, community, the need to keep communicating, and so forth. Personal note but not a deal breaker: I'm not real fond of the Bible version used (New Living Translation) so while reading I popped up a window of my favorite and that was better for me. No criticism toward NLT, it's like vanilla vs. chocolate.\n\nWill your feelings of burnout disappear by day 30? Maybe not. But you might find something that will keep you going for another 60 days. You might find the encouragement that your suffering will bring blessing. This booklet and the Mad Church Disease volume (MCD being better for long term encouragement) would be a great investment.

I will admit to being upset when one wolf is shot, as I'd kinda hoped she would become Stryde's mate. :) Thankfully I will look forward to reading no. 2 for his story.\n\nLiv Brywood takes us on another journey with these characters.

My grandmother worked for Jewish families in the 50s and 60s and I remember accompanying her to their homes when I was a youngster visiting her in NC. There is a certain nostalgia there as the Jewish people always treated her with respect and dignity.  All the while they were walking their own precarious tightrope between the gentiles and the black people.\n\nI also found something more while poring over the pages of this book and that is a link to my family's own Jewish past.

It was advertised in our local paper two days ago and I promptly logged on to Amazon and ordered one. It arrived the next day.\n\nMy goal was to replace my satellite service with free off-the-air programming, but I couldn't live without HD DVR and previous solutions were too expensive. My satellite service costs $60 a month (after my discount!) and all I use it for is local network TV... that's just ridiculous. Now my bill will be one-quarter that with no real compromise.\n\nSet-up was pretty painless, but it did take a while to do a channel scan, download guide data, and do a system software update, so be patient. Obviously, if you need a rooftop antenna, that's the hardest part.\n\nNote that you can use the basic functionality before signing up for the TiVo service (but I believe that after a week, it forces you to). This was good for me, because this purchase was a huge gamble.... Over The Air (OTA) HD reception has always been spotty in my neighborhood and in the past, unless the antenna was perfectly aligned, I only got local spanish stations, so I figured there was a 50% chance I'd have to return this. Turns out, the tuner in the TiVo is remarkable! With my cheap Radio Shack antenna, I now pick up 84(!!!) stations, mostly from San Francisco, almost 50 miles away. And I haven't seen a glitch yet.\n\nAlso note that once you sign up for TiVo service, it can take up to 24 hours for your box to register and activate, but after an hour or two, you can go to Network Settings and force an early registration.\n\nLinking the box to my Pandora, Amazon and Netflix accounts was a snap.\n\nI haven't tried linking to an iPad or Android device yet.\n\nThe only complaints so far are minor:\n\n* The UI has an odd mix of HighDef and Low-resolution screens (the classic TiVo look). I'm very surprised that a company that puts such an emphasis on the user experience isn't consistent in their UI. Navigating to the third-party services seems a bit clunky for TiVo as well. (I'm actually a UI developer for a competitor's DVR, but TiVo's OTA capabilities makes it the most cost-effective choice for me. ;^)\n\n* When setting up Season Passes, it sometimes defaults to a station that I do not actually receive and I have to force it to choose the appropriate local station.\n\n* I was also hoping there would be a tighter integration between the traditional content (DVR, OTA, Cable) and the internet services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, but you still have to navigate to a dedicated Netflix environment to get Netflix content. Wouldn't it be cool if the search feature also looked in these accounts? You bet it would. The digital world needs a good content aggregator product. This one comes closer, but leaves room for new features later on.\n\nPROS:\n* AWESOME dual tuner\n* Great TiVo DVR\n* Built in Internet apps (Netflix, et al)\n* Fantastic price (plus not-so-great $15 month for TiVo service, or $499 for lifetime)\n* Home Networking, and file sharing with computers\n\nCONS\n* None at all. Deal of the year.\n\nI just installed the TiVo Desktop while writing this. No problems, and now my TiVo has access to my complete iTunes library and I can copy recordings from the TiVo to the Mac (although it's a bit slow).\n\nWow. This thing really impresses me. This is going to be one of the coolest tech gadgets I ever bought (and I've bought a LOT) and it's going to be pure money in my pocket after 3 months.\n\nThe return of [almost] free TV with all the convenience and quality and no almost no compromises!\nThanks, TiVo!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

We live on hilltop 80 miles away (as the crow flies) from the major transmitters, with a row of forested hills between us and the valley. I never expected to get anything, but I made a valiant try.\nI bought 3 different antennas - a flat indoor antenna that did absolutely nothing indoors, but did pick up a few stations when placed on the back balcony - however it was not great and wasn't meant for the outdoors.\nI then tried a rooftop mount that resembles the saucer section of the Enterprise and it picked up a lot of channels, just not reliably. My signal strengths were in the 20's and 30's but need to be above 50 to be considered stable.\nI then got this one and at first I had nearly identical performance - even when elevated on a pole at the top of the roof. Finally I decided to take this one off the roof in favor of the more aesthetically pleasing dish antenna. As a last ditch experiment I tried it again, but from my balcony instead of on the roof. I have no idea why, but my signal strengths all jumped by 20 points. I know get 48 channels, about half stable. At a distance of 80 miles I get totally solid HD from 3 of the 4 major network.\n\nThe lesson I learned, that I want to pass on, is to note that this antenna does a great job, but is VERY sensitive to positioning, so like I did, do a LOT of experimentation if you're on the fringe. If I move my antenna to any other location or change any axis by more than an inch or two, my signal drops considerably, but if you can find that sweet spot, this antenna does an amazing job. If you live a lot closer to the transmitters, you'll probably love this smallish, lightweight, inexpensive antenna.\n\nGood luck!!!\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.94}, {"id": "21895", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThe author took us on a journey of betrayal, hatered, bondage, trust,  new found love, confrontation, double-cross, revenge, freedom.

I was walking around one day in my slippers (approx three weeks into owning them) and noticed a stench kept following me..despite having just taken a shower.  I was washing dishes and smelt the smell.  I sat and was watching tv..there was the smell.  I blamed the dog..the kids...until one day I happen to  lean down and take my slipper off (I usually just kick them off). It's hard to describe the stench that came out of my slippers...it was like death.  It made my eyes water.  I have never had any smell come out of any of my Ugg boots...I was totally mortified and ordered the Ugg cleaning kit.  It did nothing but make me miserable because then after cleaning I kept having to smell the slippers to see if the cleaning had worked and it hadn't.\n\nFinally I dumped baking soda in them and febrezzed them.  I let them sit for days and that helped.  The stench is more mild and sometimes I catch a whiff (like a wet dog following me around). Apparently (and probably everyone knows this except me) but be very careful about letting any moisture in these shoes.  I use to put the slippers on after taking a shower (I would dry off) but my feet must have still had too much moisture on them.  The moisture can make these slippers stink like you would not believe!\n\nIn the mean time while 'the stinkys' were left to de-stink, I bought another pair of Ugg slippers and wanted to let others know that the Ugg Dakota KID slippers in size 6 fit a woman's size 8 perfectly  and took much less time to break in (a few hours vs days like these). They are just as comfortable as these slippers but I paid $52 and shipped Prime so almost half the cost.  I will include pics of them next to these slippers.\n\nI love these slippers but they were very, very tight when I tried them on Christmas morning.  I have multiple pairs of Ugg boots in size 8.  In all my other shoes I am a solid 8.5.  My husband bought 8.  I stuffed my feet into these slippers and prayed they would stretch.  At first I was convinced there was no way they would stretch enough to make them comfortable, but they did.  It took a few days of wearing them for them to stretch and for the fur to mat down.  I wore them all day today and the fit is perfect.  I was so close to packing them back up and ordering a 9 but I'm glad I didn't as the 9 would have inevitably stretched and been too big.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Two sisters of diametrically opposed personalities become estranged during the Nazi occupation of France in the 1940s. Written from the sisters' point of view, men are secondary or, in the case of their negligent father, serve to shape their resolve. Except for the old and infirm, the men of the defeated French army are now in POW camps. Of course, the women really do love each other, and the novel traces the route to reconciliation. Elements of romance novels are also present, as we must endure passages in which hearts flutter and passions erupt at fateful meetings. Tragedy and farfetched coincidences abound.\n\nHowever, and this is a big however, and despite the headwinds mentioned above, she has crafted an engaging and compelling story of the hardships and mind numbing oppression of German occupation. How to cope? Barely, in the case of the stay at home less adventuresome sister (\"needs must\") and by joining the resistance early on in the case of the younger more beautiful one. To be fair, the older sister does eventually summon up some resolve, at great danger to her, to assist with orphan  rescue efforts.\n\nThe story moves along smartly by virtue of the author's graphic description of life in that almost surrealistic world. Especially gripping are the chapters on life and death in the concentration camps. There are also opportunities to shed a tear or engage in full fledged blubbering. She wraps up the story by tying up all loose ends and thereby establishing a state of exhausted equilibrium. This is not the literary equivalent of \"All the Light We Can Not See\", but an easier read style-wise that also makes a contribution to our understanding of that dreadful period.

Not that I think Patterson's commentary is 'bad' in any way, though I do think it is lacking in certain respects.  So, my three star review may indicate a small disagreement as to what the nature of a commentary 'is' or should be - rather than critiquing Patterson's theological position or exegesis.\n\nI do think there are some very good parts of the book.  The second part of the commentary, in the exegesis of the first part of Revelation concerning the cities, their historical background and therefore their proper place in the exegesis of this particular part of Revelation is great.  And Patterson is able to make his case for his pre-trib premil viewpoint quite nicely.  If you are looking for a good, standard, pre-trib premil commentary, you would have to look no further.\n\nHowever, I think Patterson does not significantly deal with other interpretations.  Often, he only does show very shallowly.  Again, I think a commentary should significantly deal with other interpretations, moreso than Patterson did--but, I'm not saying that literally EVERY single commentary has to.  The NAC attempts to be laymen friendly I think -- so it tries to walk a fine line between overtly scholarly and down to earth.  For example, Patterson's treatment of numbers and their symbology are also shallow, or often ignored.  He does not go to great lengths to explain why he exegetes certain things literally and other things from the same text symbolically.  And I think he also gets sidetracked at times.  Near the end of the work, when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, Patterson spends several pages telling us the mineral make-up of the various foundation stones and other geological facts, but never explains why knowing these random facts about these minerals is important.  And last (and least), I am frustrated with the textual editor of this work.  The format of bold-face citing of what verses Patterson is exegeting is often randomly missing at times.  Again, this may seem petty, but gets annoying after this happens several times.\n\nIf you identify as a Southern Baptist as I do, or have been to a Southern Baptist Seminary, you will understand what I mean when I say this is standard Southern Baptist exegesis.  The commentary is not deep, but to be fair it's not too shallow at every turn.  It falls right in line with what you would expect from a Southern Baptist commentary.  People only trained in the Southern Baptist tradition will no doubt love it, while those that have trained at other places may find it lacking.  But it is what it is.  If you want a good pretrib, premil commentary, this will be a good purchase.  If you are looking for a commentary on Revelation that deals significantly with other interpretations of Revelation, I would suggest elsewhere.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

In terms of a 'review,' I don't have a whole lot to say.  It's a one-volume commentary on every book of the Bible, weighing in at a few pounds.  I acquired this several years ago in my undergraduate study for a class.  Using it for that class and putting it up I neglected it for several years.  I was able to blow the dust off this year and went through book by book of the Bible in no certain order, supplementing it with this commentary.\n\nThe structure of the book itself is like any other commentary.  It begins each book of the Bible by discussing the nature of the book in question.  Who is the author(s)?  When was it written?  What was its purpose?  What theological implications are apparent in the text?  Any interpretative problems?  Then MacArthur breaks down the structure of the book and comments on most verses.\n\nThe book is designed to be an introductory commentary.  By that I mean, this is designed for the layperson who may have never picked up a biblical commentary before.  It's short, sweet and to the point in virtually every case.  And there are also many helpful charts, maps, and other goodies that are a good complement to the commentary.  So, it's also a helpful resource tool for a Sunday School teacher, part time pastor or the educated layperson.  Despite my three star rating (which isn't a 'bad' rating, per se), I think a lot of Christians would benefit from having this on their bookshelf.\n\nAny negatives from me are purely personal reasons that will likely not apply to anyone else, though I will briefly mention them.  I'm not particularly crazy about MacArthur's writing style.  I think it's often too terse and many times throughout the book I find myself reading things that MacArthur asserts that he should be more cautious about - he seems to speculate on many things that I'm not sure we have certain knowledge about.  It's kind of like Norman Geisler does with some of his writings (if you're familiar with any of his works).  And at other times I think he reads his theology into certain texts.  I think he does this with the warning passages of the New Testament, for example.  But, these are small critiques and don't affect the overall quality of the book.\n\nWhy the three star rating?  Well, I've read many basic commentaries in my day and so this is white noise for books that I read, but that doesn't mean I don't think it's an objectively helpful resource to have.  The rating system on here is one of personal preference, and the three star rating literally says \"It's okay.\"  And it's in that vein that I'm rating this three stars.  It's 'ok' to me.  It didn't knock my socks off and I knew what to expect so five stars just wasn't in the bag.  But it's nothing personal, and to be honest I think its high rating on this page is consistent with the book's quality.\n\nThere are virtually no downsides in any objective fashion that I have to mention.

The gentle meditational meanderings of their debut album, \"Devotion\", have evolved here into a deeper, more beat-driven style.  Retained, however, are the foundations of their signature sound--Kim Waters' melodic Sanskrit chants supported by Hans Christian's exotic improvisations on cello, sarangi, nyckelharpa and synthesizer.  Layered expertly into the instrumentals in ever-developing layers of complexity are the stylings of numerous other artists as well: Girish Gambira on tabla, udu, mridangam, spring drum and morcheng; John Loose on ghatam, kartals, kanjira, cabasa, maracca, triangles, shakers, hi-hat and tambourine; John Wubbenhorst on bansuri flute; Alan Kozlowski on bamsa vina, Bhima Karma on kartals, and vocalist Yamuna Devi.  Don't ask me what most of those instruments are, but you get the general idea--Rasa's rich, full fusion sound is heavily influenced by traditional Indian music, and to very pleasing effect.  Notable tracks on \"Union\" include the sensual \"Hari Haraye\", in which Waters' soothing voice winds sinuously over itself in overdubs while Christian's sarangi wails a delicate, microtonal descant; \"Sri Guru\", a two-part musical epic featuring the lovely Bansuri flute; and the vocal duet \"Govindam\", which builds in speed and intensity to end at fever pitch before fading out in a peaceful coda.  Rasa's next album, similar in style to this one is \"Shelter\".  For another take on the blending of Sanskrit chant with modern western melodies, you might enjoy the work of Krishna Das.

The tone of \"Temple of Love\" is a bit more whimsical and spacey than that of previous albums, with more synthesizer ambience and less emphasis on drum beats.  Kim Waters' voice glides and croons above a symphony of gentle instrumentals, overdubbed by Hans Christian on a multitude of stringed instruments ranging from cello and Scandinavian nyckleharpa to Indian sitar and sarangi, not to mention keyboards and ethnic percussion.  Though unique unto itself, Rasa's music was developing a tendency to all sound the same after a while.  This dreamy, laid back album is a welcome departure, with some new modes and melodies, and different orchestrations.  That being said, the first track \"Jaya Radhe\" (while not at all the same as the similarly named \"Jaya Radha\" from the previous album, \"Shelter\") does sound very similar to something I remember hearing on an earlier release, but I can't place it.  The other songs, however, are fresh and new.

Published shortly after the Columbine massacre, it doesn't take Long to figure out what's coming, but that doesn't take away from the novel's guided tour through the trials and tribulations of a high school student's life, and the humorous - yet touching - struggles involved in these tumultuous time of life for those who are unavoidably \"different\" like Allen and his brothers and sisters.\n\nFor those looking for a more serious examination of the causes behind school shootings such as Columbine, I would recommend looking elsewhere, such as Jim Shepard's Project X. Not because Cadre's novel does not take these events seriously, but only because some of the fantastic characters and events within the novel are separated enough from reality so that the Columbine aspects are more a part of the story than the reason or overall message.

Project X refuses to fall into this simple-minded trap. Edwin and Flake, the two teenage characters in the book, are portrayed as the complex personalities that people really are, and not the easily categorized stereotypes that people tend to see each other as.\n\nThe protagonists in Shepard's book aren't simply misanthropic loners by choice. They are bullied and harassed on a daily basis, in and out of school, by people they know and complete strangers, and by adults as well as teenagers. The toll of this repeated physical abuse, egged on by their inability (both physically and emotionally) to fight back, forces them to withdraw from society.

Their self-imposed alienation and inability to explain their situation to someone who could assist them, coupled with increasingly anti-social and reactionary behavior, just makes them easier targets and escalates the situation even further.\n\nIf this were just about bullies, the playgrounds across the country would be a never ending battlefield (and for some, it is). There are often other influences involved, and Shepard exposes some of these as well. The psychological instability of both characters is well displayed, but never left as a final scapegoat. Allusions to a previous head injury possibly causing some of Edwin's emotional problems, as well as Flake's apparent sexual confusion and sometimes aggressive domination over Edwin in their friendship, add to the pressures and overwhelming confusion. It is all too easy to forget that some kids live with stress levels that often drive adults to nervous breakdowns.\n\nShepard doesn't just trap these characters in a world where no one cares about them or notices the problem. Edwin's parents are well aware that their son is troubled, and try to both understand and lend emotional support. But their awkward attempts to reach out never manage to break through the confusion and despair. Their rebellious behavior makes Edwin and Flake an easy target for the scorn of teachers and other adults, but even some of them attempt to help through positive reinforcement, and enrolling Edwin in an after-school program for troubled youth.\n\nThe true brilliance of Project X is that Shepard manages to easily evoke sympathy, and even empathy, for Edwin and Flake. Most readers will no doubt find themselves not only wanting to help them, but wondering what could have been done differently. Through fictional characters and events, Shepard is giving the reader a glimpse behind the curtain that hides most of these kids until it is far too late to do anything but pick up the pieces and wonder to ourselves what went wrong?\n\nI have read other reviews of this book, and I am surprised by two common reactions to Project X. One is the repeated comparison of Project X to Vernon God Little, which is unfair to both books. Vernon God Little is a great book in its own right, but only uses troubled youth as a foundation for its story, and in no way attempts to expose or explore the serious issues that Project X does. This is almost like comparing Gus Van Sant's Elephant to Napoleon Dynamite.\n\nThe other reaction is from those who complain about the book's ending. Some readers wanted more about the aftermath of the events at the end of the book, and felt the need for closure. I feel that these people missed the point entirely.\n\nProject X is not about school shootings. It isn't about the victims or their families, the assailants or their families, the media coverage afterward, or the attempts by those affected to somehow pick up the shattered remains of what used to be their lives. The truth is, there is no real closure after such a tragedy.\n\nProject X is about what happens before these tragic events. It is about the children who become lost amongst us, the demons that plague and influence them, and most importantly, what finally drives them over the edge. Jim Shepard knows the truth; the only way to save ourselves from them is to learn how to save them from themselves.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.15}, {"id": "21925", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis is a nice looking desk which is the reason I purchased it, but had I known it would be so difficult to put up, I might have passed. I bought this desk to match my TV stand made by the same manufacturer, but unlike my TV stand which I put up in about 3 hours with plenty of breaks, this stand took me a few days due to stripped parts and missing items.\n\nAt first it seemed like a simple set of instructions, putting the side legs(left/right) together was done while watching TV. The difficult part came when trying to install the back skirts that hold the right/left legs together. The instructions don't tell you that but from my experience unless you are very handy or really think this out you need at least 2 people to do that.  The bad thing about this desk is that it uses wood glue combined with screws to hold some parts together, however once you use the glue you are through ! If you make a mistake that mistake is permanent. You can't just unscrew and start all over.\n\nI called Sauder and they were very nice in supplying new parts to replace my damaged ones but I had to wait 4 days for the parts to get here. Sauder said to call them so they can give you instructions on how best to put this desk together,  but they are closed on weekends when I have the time for project like these.\n\nAnother problem I had was with the drawers, they just did not seem to fit \"flush\" no matter how hard I tried. And you can only try a few times without stripping the guide for the screws. I finally got this thing together and it looks great I must admit, but it is a lot lighter and less solid than I thought, compared to the package it came in which weighted about a ton.\n\nFor this price, or a little more I could have gotten a solid 'real' wood pre-assembled desk and saved myself all the hassle ! Oh well, at least the shipping was free which made a huge difference.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It is filled with the type of subtle sexism that no woman in the workplace should tolerate for one moment and the author (and apparently her readers!) portray this as not only acceptable and tolerable, but even desirable!\nSpoilers below!!!\n\nThe first third of the book is all about a guy sexually harassing a woman at work and behaving horribly toward her while she acts like a brainless nitwit worrying about him instead of worrying about her work and behaving like someone mature and professional. The behavior of the guy is the kind of sexual harassment and sexism that should get a person fired. And this book is making it seem like that is what women WANT in the workplace. The author portrays Lucy as desiring the hated coworker's leering and ogling at her body and making sexual comments to her. And with no warning whatsoever the \"hated\" man grabs Lucy in the elevator and kisses her without permission or warning. And the author portrays this as a great sexy moment.\n\nWhile the last two thirds of the book improve in the fact that Josh (the hated man) begins to behave more like a normal person toward Lucy, Lucy continues to behave like a petulant child. She tolerates being leered at by an older male superior at work who tries to look down her blouse regularly and the author portrays this like it's a normal occurrence and something Lucy simply tolerates until finally JOSH of all people gives her the courage to say something about it. Nice sexist trope. The woman as helpless child who needs a man to give her courage and guide her.\n\nIn addition to describing sexual harassment and immature behavior as normal and acceptable in the work world, the author's depiction of the corporate world itself is laughable. Lucy works for a woman CEO but instead of having any real conversations with this woman, Lucy whines to her about her dating life. And Lucy's internal dialogue describes NOT the powerful woman's accomplishments, intelligence, or anything substantive, but rather, the woman's wardrobe and how much Lucy covets it. Is this for real?\n\nGirls, this book is trash. And not because of the sex scenes. It's trash because it portrays Lucy as a ridiculous child obsessed with men and tolerant of being belittled and harassed by male coworkers. Complete crap.\nScore:"}], "output": "1 \n\n", "formatted_output": "1", "model_inf_time": 1.29}, {"id": "21942", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThey are pretty as well as doing the job they were made for.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

One of those who lost their lives was New York Police Detective Simon Ziele's fiancee, Hanah. With so many people having lost friends and family, Ziele moved to the village of Dobson, New York, looking for peace.\n\nHis peace is shattered when Simon and his boss, Joe Healy, are summoned to the home of Mrs. Virginia Wingate, where her niece, Sara, has been brutally murdered.\n\nThe killing made no sense. Sara had only recently arrived at the Wingate's in search of a place where she could study. She was a student in her fourth year at Columbia. She is active in the movement to enable women to have more voice in politics.\n\nSimon is visited by Alistair Sinclair, a professor of law at Columbia and a criminologist. He states that he believes that Michael Fromley might be the killer. Alistair claims that Fromley has killed previously.

She is fresh out of accounting school and takes a job on a large secluded ranch in Montana.  She is glad to get away from Philadelphia and thinks this could be a new start for herself and her young daughter, Summer.  Riley has been on her own for many years and usually holds herself apart from others.  She also has some secrets that she is hiding as she tries to protect herself and her daughter.\n\nZane is the youngest of three cousins on the Lost Nugget Ranch. Although he has watched his older cousins settle down with new wives, he doesn't see that happening to change his sexy, bachelor life style.  He tends not to trust women after watching his selfish mother ruin his father and his own childhood.\nThe story moves quickly with the attraction between Riley and Zane growing slowly but surely. The family gives a warm welcome to Riley and her daughter and I enjoyed the development of relationships between other family members and the delightful child, Summer.  I also enjoyed the added side romance of Aunt Cora`s long time unacknowledged love for the rugged ranch foreman, Cal. The story focuses more on the family relationships than the continued search for the lost treasure.  When it is revealed that Riley may be in danger, she is ready to flee rather than bring danger to the ranch family. But by this point Zane is willing to acknowledge his feelings for her and he won't let her run. The family bands together to help Riley overcome the danger.\nThere are some small but annoying errors in the book - I really don't like when names are mixed up for the main characters. The danger is obvious to the readers although the characters are oblivious. Considering they had been through troubles in prior books in the series (which I had not read) this seemed unrealistic. Also at times the story seemed a bit contrived instead of having a completely natural flow.  I think that may be because it was wrapping up a series and tying up some loose ends. Even with those cons, the story is warm and touching and brought tears to my eyes.  The romance is sweet and deep without any direct sex and the child character is adorable. I recommend this as an easy, enjoyable read and I like the writing and characters enough that I would be glad to go back and  read the first two books about the other members of this loving family.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Edward has totally bought into the position of teaming with Ainsley as his practical society wife. He believes that he can manage a life with her and won't have to worry about the pain that he associates with a passionate love. The thing is--Ainsley doesn't love Edward and dreams of freedom to pursue expanding her florist shop. On the other hand, her rebellious and free spirit sister, Cecelia, has had a crush on Edward for years. Cecelia has decided to escape their mother by spending a summer week on a Wyoming `dude' ranch as a bachelorette candidate for the handsome cowboy owner.  The girls decide to trade places when their mother books Ainsley on a romantic cruise with Edward.\n\nRiley is the reluctant bachelor who has to entertain a group of bachelorettes. The scheme was his sisters' idea to increase the income of the ranch and use a dating competition to test the ranch for women to come to a dude ranch destination.\n\nRiley has always played the field and has no intention of settling down just to please his siblings who are struggling with the recent loss of their dad. Ainsley has no plans to fall for a cowboy. She plans to use the time investigating the ranch family green house.\n\nRiley isn't pleased to have to take several days to entertain eight overly eager women. However, he is quickly intrigued by the one woman who isn't fawning over him. Ainsley isn't interested in competing for attention but she has a hard time ignoring the sparks when she gets close to Riley. The other jealous women make nasty innuendos and start suspicious rumors to interfere with the growing relationship between Ainsley and Riley. Edward showing up to claim Ainsley as his fiancee only complicates matters.\n\nThis turned out to be a fun story and you sort of get a \"two-fer\" as you get Ainsley's romance and Cecelia's struggles to win over Edward.  The other female candidates make some good characters to dislike as they create conflict.  The writing style is easy and the plot is fun and engaging. Riley has commitment issues while Ainsley has fear of confrontation issues to overcome. Riley's siblings, a teenage boy and his sisters, are clearly characters who may develop for further stories. This is a good summer read for those who enjoy bachelorette antics and conflicted romance stories.\nTitle received from Forever/Hachette through NetGalley for an honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.87}, {"id": "21950", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nLove it!

Blakely brings to life the City of Lights!\n\nPlus, youll meet two extraordinary and adventurous individuals with different time tables.  Oh!  How I loved these characters.  Lauren Blakely has given us not one, but two, very strong and determined characters.  The fact that Joy can give as good as she gets was a real plus.  She is no shrinking violet.  Its tit-for-tat with this couple.  Joy and Griffin are both coping with heartbreak  one from the breakup of a long-term relationship and the other the death of his brother.  Despite the heartbreak and tragedy seen on both ends of the building relationship, these feelings don't upstage the beauty of their story.  They deal with life head-on in an intelligent, hopeful and lively manner.  And readers won't be disappointed when they're invited to join in the delightful amusements behind that hot pink door and up the uneven eighty-four steps where youll find plenty of flirtatious banter, lots of laughter, intimate and an erotic and seductive romantic romp that is nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nNot that Im complaining, but this is the second book Ive read this week that included a bucket list of items to complete in honor of another person.  Griffins brother died leaving behind his unfinished to dos.  But maybe hed already done his part, and this list was meant for someone else entirely.

A very graphic story of a beautiful young woman attempting to survive in a country where no one was safe from repercussions. We know from history what happened to the Jews, intellectuals, homosexuals or anyone else that was deemed a threat to the Nazis, but what of the purebred Aryan Germans? Were they immune to the state? NO! If their allegiance was undying, they stood a chance. But as we see with the character Anna and her master, one slip and one would find themselves a guest at the camp:Buchenwald. No one was safe. Loyalty wasn't asked for, it was demanded and Anna did what was required to survive a very brutal three years of subservience.\n\nMany have stated how they didn't like Anna. She's too cold and unfeeling. She speaks nothing of the past and doesn't tell her daughter (Gertrude) who her real father is. Why should she? It would only add more pain and humiliation for her survival instincts. How many woman today really enjoy discussing being raped? Is it not better to stay in the past? Being a male, I can not nor shall I attempt to offer an opinion.\n\nI was very disappointed that the forced visit to Buchenwald wasn't addressed. This was pivotal a time when the German people (and she) were really introduced to the crimes of the government.

I purchased this RPG10 package using gift cards from the kids + $140 out of pocket, so the price was right.  Total shipping weight for the three boxes was around 84lbs and Fedex delivered the kit (inside my house, not just to the porch) 4 business days after ordering.\n\nIf I had spent $280+ of my own money on these speakers, I'd be sending them back and buying another brand.  Both speakers have an annoying hum, even with all knobs turned all the way down and no audio cables connected.  In a quiet room, the hum can be heard at least 25 feet away when standing directly in line with the speakers.  As you move to the left or the right of the speakers, the hum tends to fade away to a point it becomes less annoying.  I am in the habit of turning the speakers outwards so they are not directly pointed at anyone so nobody has to listen to the hum head on.  I may end up buying another brand speaker before it is all over with as I'd like to own some PA speakers that I could use for charitable fund raisers, like trivia nights and dinner auctions.  I'm afraid the annoying electrical hum on these Rockville speakers would keep me from being able to use them for that purpose.  If I was going to be pumping music through these speakers non-stop all night long, then I wouldn't worry about the hum because once you turn up the music the hum isn't a problem.\n\nAs for the sound of these speakers when listening to music, the mids and the highs sound incredible all the time.  Songs with a lot of deep boosted bass distorts quickly so you have to turn the bass down to a point where it is only punchy.  Once you have the bass setting tweaked, the speakers put out an incredible amount of good sounding punchy bass.  I find you have to tweak the bass a lot from song to song as one song will be distorted and the next song won't have hardly any bass at all.  I hardly ever have to do that with my home theater system, but you have to do it all the time with these PA speakers.  Fortunately for me, my wife gave me that 15\" powered sub so I let the sub take care of most my bass needs.\n\nOne last comment.  When I went to pull the speakers off the stands the first time, one of the stand pole caps came free from the pole and stayed inside the bottom of the speaker.  I pried it out and left it off.  The speaker is now easier to put on and take off the pole.  I went ahead and pulled the other pole cap off too.\n\nUpdate 1/2/2015 - Today one of the two speakers was acting as if it had a short in it.  The problem went away on it's own before I could catch it on video.  Hopefully it doesn't come back.  I emailed Rockville support two days ago about the hum and haven't received a reply yet.  I will try calling them today to discuss both issues.\n\nUpdate 1/4/2015 - The short in the second speaker has appeared again.  It only occurs when using the XLR port on the second input.  I was unable to get the support department at Audiosavings to respond to multiple emails, and got voice mail every time I called their support number so I have filed a claim thru Amazon.  They have 3 days to respond or I'm going to request for a full refund.  I'm more then willing to spend the little extra money for the Pyle or Behringer powered speakers.\n\nUpdate 1/9/2015 - After several emails back and forth, I did receive an RMA number and a free shipping label from Audiosavings to send back the defective speaker.  Crossing my fingers that I get a good replacement. In the mean time, I ordered and received two of the Powerwerks PW50 powered speakers that sell for around $110 each.  They don't get anywhere close as loud as the Rockvilles, but they sound super clean (and no annoying hum, yeah!)  I'm going to be saving up all my change and purchasing a couple of the Powerwerks PW100 or PW150 powered speakers if they ever go on sale.  Btw, the AudioSavings audio engineer confirmed that hum coming from these Rockville speakers is normal, as long as it's not excessively loud.\n\nUpdate 1/19/2015 - I just received a replacement speaker from my RMA.  A 10 day turn around is very good in my opinion.  The new speaker doesn't match my other good speaker, and it doesn't match the pictures on Amazon... so there must be three different versions of these speakers out there.  This speaker doesn't have the annoying hum, which is great news.  This new speaker has two teardrop shaped port holes at the bottom front where my other one has a more of a jack-o-lantern smile type port hole that spans the entire bottom front of the speaker.  Right now I'm conflicted and confused.  Not sure if it's worth complaining about or not.  I will play with both speakers for the next several weeks and see if I have any problems with either of them.\n\nPros:\n1) the speakers look sexy.  It doesn't matter if your 16 or 60, you are going to love the curves on these things.\n2) the music is loud, 5 out of 5 stars loud.\n3) the music is pretty clean sounding, 3 out of 5 stars clean.\n4) these speakers fill a very large area with good quality sound.  Although the Rockville RBG-15S 15\" sub makes it sound even better.\n4) for the low price, you get a lot more sound then expected.\n\nCons:\n1) the HUM is always there and never completely goes away.\n2) speaker stands could be of better quality.\n3) I have already had to return 1 speaker in a short amount of time after purchasing them.\n4) the warranty is only 1 year, and you have to pay your own shipping if you don't live near an authorized service center.\n5) Audio Savings' support department is a bit slow to respond to emails.\n\n2015-July : It's worth mentioning that I purchased a 12v power inverter for using these speakers outdoors when electric wasn't available.  The two speakers + a HP mini notebook used 110 - 125 watts of electricity combined, depending on how much bass was present in a song.  Indoors in a small room, one speaker at a comfortable volume ran 15 - 20 watts of electrical usage and went up to 60 watts at a very uncomfortable volume.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I had to keep it down very low to keep the music from distorting.  If I turned the volume knob more that 25%, it sounded awful  I was not happy with these speakers one little bit.  I had heard much better sound coming from cheaper ~$25 amplified computer speakers before.\n\nI then connected the speakers to my other computer that has a Behringer UCA202 USB sound card.  The speakers sounded nice and clean, but still not that loud.  The bass was fine if I was sitting 3 feet in front of the speakers, but get up and walk out of the room and all you would hear is mids and treble.  I tried mixing them with my 400 watt sub and was able to achieve a nice pleasant sound mix, but still the speakers definitely were not sounding worth the $150 dollars that I paid for them.  Matter of fact, I was thinking \"they couldn't possibly be putting out more than about 20 watts!\"\n\nThen a friend loaned me their Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! Pro USB sound card and WOW what a difference.  Now these speakers sound better than my 2 x 50 watt Kustom/Powerwerks PA speakers.  I don't need to mix in the 400 watt sub either because these thing push out more than enough bass on their own.  Now I'm thinking, \"How can these things only be putting out 50 watts?\"  I have ordered 2 of those USB Sound Blasters and can't wait until Monday when they show up.\n\nUpdate:  It's worth mentioning that the default crossover cutoff on the Sound Blaster was set to 80Hz using the default windows sound card driver.  Since I had the CR4 speakers I changed the cutoff to be 75Hz and it made a big difference.  Later, I downloaded and installed the latest Creative Labs sound driver from their website and it made the speakers sound even better!  So don't just accept the default driver that windows wants to install.\n\nUpdate:  I have tried these speaker out in several different spaces and they sound there best in my small 9' x 10' office, about 8 inches away from the wall.  They fill my office with big booming sound.  You would swear they were big home stereo speakers with a sub woofer attached,  As for larger spaces, they are not big enough to fill my 16' x 24' family room with sound, nor are they big enough for outdoor use.  The mids and treble sound so much better on these Mackies than any of my other speakers I have in the house regardless which space they are in.  They sound amazing for the small size.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 3.45}, {"id": "21958", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nMy 3 year old helped me put this together.

Priscilla is a thirtysomething waitress in a greasy spoon restaurant presided over by its volatile owner, Frank. Lacking in confidence, and disillusioned by too many unsatisfactory relationships, Priscilla appears to have reached a dead end in her life and dreams of heading south to start anew  but to start what exactly? Philip is an architect whose sinking building project appears to have scuppered his high-flying career. On top of that, his wife is suing for divorce, and he risks losing access to his beloved daughter. Tobias is a middle-aged rock star with a penchant for younger women, and is plotting a comeback but suspects his muse may have deserted him.\nWhen fate throws these individuals together, all their lives are changed forever.\nMs. Hamilton has an engaging style, and although her characters are in some way damaged, the writing never becomes gloomy or heavy-handed. She also carefully avoids proselytising, letting the reader make up his own mind about the protagonists. Unusually for a writer in this genre, the author gives us time to get to know her main characters, while the minor players are sketched with a few deft strokes of the virtual pen. The alternating points of view provide interest to the narrative, and give texture and variety to the proceedings. The novel is nicely paced (mirroring the various areas of NYC), and one is never entirely sure how the various plotlines will resolve themselves.\nI highly recommend this feel-good book.

Can Garret Nash assist and protect her without being chased off by Aundy's fear of getting romantically involved once again?\n\nThe book is rich in historical detail since the author actually lived in Pendleton. Descriptions of farm life, the the town of Pendleton, and the colorful tight-knit community that embraces Aundy make for great reading. This is book one of a trilogy. I so enjoyed Aundy I am looking forward to her sister's story entitled Ilse and the third entitled Caterina. If you crave a feel-good story with a happy ending, this series is for you.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I didn't like the main character, but the supporting ones were better (Toni, Devon).  The main character was beyond irritatingly naive, stuck up,stubborn,unrealistic, bougie, and really boring with horrid communication issues meaning, she has no problem constantly assuming what someone else is thinking smh.  My pet peeve is people who 'think talk' issues in a story.  What is so hard about asking a question that SHOULD be asked? She was kind of unrealistic to me and I had a hard time figuring out what it was about her that these men loved, well besides the truly platonic male friends. She was no fun at all, didn't like color until the end, I understand folks having 'quirks' but come on, she was one of those people that needed to be alone or take a class on people and social skills, she needed to learn how to communicate instead of constantly thinking what someone else is feeling and believing her own version and just leaving without even having spoken to the person, she just thinks something, gets mad and leave.  The abortion thing really bothered me especially when she said it was 'her body' and she was going to do this after just leaving one state, going back home to the ex boyfriend announcing she was pregnant by the current bf and was going to have an abortion simply because she was mad at what some random female told her and pictures that she found WITHOUT even talking to him, asking questions.  It's too many women in the world that do stuff like that, have an abortion out of emotion, and that wasn't her first time.  She did it years before with the current boyfriend because she FELT like and THOUGHT that's what he wanted without talking to him about something so serious.  She really irritated me, I'd have rather have read more about her supporting characters Toni, Devon, or even her sister Sienna, maybe even Patrick, but the main character was someone I just didn't and couldn't like.\nGreat premise, a little wordy, otherwise it's a good read on a rainy day.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The women with too much money and the women with not enough money are equally uninteresting.  Their stories start out fine, with juicy details and promising back story, but in the long run they never generate anything truly compelling.\n\nJulia is maligned for \"abandoning\" her family, but do we ever see any real consequences of this?  Other than a couple of passing uncomfortable moments, do we ever see her really struggle with her choices--choices that were supposedly so difficult, they caused her to have a breakdown?  Robyn's \"extracurricular\" activities are revealed in detail and then dropped just as quickly, with no apparent fallout.  Lianne gets exactly one angry outburst to reveal her character, and Christy's malaise...well, there must be some reason why Christy is so unhappy. Lucy's problems begin and end in the first chapter (oh no, we lost everything...oh, well, we love each other more than ever and everything's great now.)\n\nThe novel is ostensibly about motherhood and friendship, but there is scant evidence of anyone's actual family life, and I had a hard time figuring out why any of these women would be friends with each other. None of their characters are deep or developed enough to make the friendships seem real.  As Julia says, \"It might be true but it doesn't feel real.\"  I know there really are people like the women in the novel, people with fascinating-but-unlikely careers, people with so much money they can't think of anything to do, people who screw around and do activities like EAL and rent cabins for the holidays, but none of the characters in this novel ever seemed quite finished to me.\n\nNormally I love fiction about people whose lives are very different from mine.  It's a chance to escape and vicariously experience something new.  But I wasn't interested enough in any of these women to pay much attention to their stories.

We had to narrow it down to one and decided this speed boat gave a good balance of size, activity and accessories. It's also the one toy that is very reminiscent of the boat he rides when visiting friends at the lake. It's a great way to flex his imagination in the tub with a good amount of varied play.\n\nThe volume of accessories that come with this boat in insane! Swim fins, a cooler with removable drinks, life jackets, snorkels, binoculars, sandals, thermos and even a cap that doesn't seem to fit most heads. Downside on all these items is they are easy to lose if you aren't careful keeping up with them, and they can easy go down the bath drain. The boat has features like a storage under the back seat, a storage trunk in back of the boat, and storage under the front seat. So that's a good place t put unused items. The boat can accept an attachment (not included) of a battery operated propeller that Playmobil has on some of their other toys.\n\nWe have had fun with our son setting up various poses of the family of four included in the set before his bath. Had them all sitting in the boat. Had the kids hanging onto the rear ladder with their snorkels on. Had everybody with refreshments in hand. Lots of things to keep your child's imagination going. The boat itself is rather solidly made and doesn't take in any water under normal floating conditions. You would have to make a bit of an effort order for enough water to get into the boat, and even then it's easy to drain. You do have stickers to add to the boat, and so far we have had this toy a year and no stickers have faded or worn out from normal use.\n\nAll in all a great water toy for your kid as long as they are old enough to not put the small accessories in their mouth (choking hazard) or are good with them to not lose them or get them sucked down the drain. It's a reliable floating toy that can take to the water a lot better than many toys I have seen in the market claiming to work in the tub.

The whole package includes three poseable figures, oars for the raft, a rain cap for the kids as well as a snorkel and swim fins for the kids.

The Real Deal was no different, it was witty and romantic. Its a story that will certainly leave you waiting for more.\n\nAt the beginning of the story we get to meet April Hamilton, she is a body-point artist who has worked really hard to establish a successful career in New York. Being from a small town, she was used to being around her family all the time until she decided to break away from her small-town life and travel to New York in hopes of making it big. But no matter what she does in her career, it will never be a real job to her family. They don't see body-painting as an actual career and they want her to go back home where she belongs. After going through a really bad break-up, April decides to not date at all and focus on her career instead. This makes things a lot more complicated with her family and to help her see their side they decide to set her up with every eligible bachelor in their small town in Connecticut. But when she has to go back home for a family reunion, April doesnt want to go alone and ends up hiring a fake boyfriend to take home with her. Meeting Theo for the first time wasn't what she thought it would be like. There is an instant connection between them right away thats sizzling and sexy! They understand each other and the more time they spend together, the more she starts to realize that he might just be the one.\n\nTheo Banks never aspired to be an actor, but he is really good at it and if it pay the bills hell do just about anything. When he needs the money to pay off a debt, Theo posts an ad on Craigslist in hopes of getting hired. When his friend calls him for a gig, he immediately accepts and decides to meet April the next day. From that moment on, he has been going crazy over her and he doesnt know what to do about it. He needs the money and he cant get himself involved with a client. But when he meets her family, they are all nice to him and he feels like he belongs with them. Something that he hasn't been able to feel after his parents passed away. Yet there is something that he is not telling April, something that could damage what they have and hell have convince her that he might just be the right guy for her before its too late.\n\nI absolutely loved this book, it was sweet and funny! Lauren Blakely knows how to deliver a great story and she did it again with The Real Deal. April is the creative one in her family and wanting to make a career out of it makes her relatable to anyone who has felt the same way. Its clear that she has a loving family that want the best for her, yet they don't understand what she does. In the story we get to see them interact and it was so much fun to read. Their family reunion is not your typical reunion and thats what made the story that much more entertaining to read. What I love the most about this story was the moments that we get with just the two main characters. It was romantic and swoon worthy. Theo is not your typical bad boy, he is just very charming and likable. There are problems along the way, but they help each other and it all works out in the end. The ending was very creative and it totally fit the vive of the story very well. I highly recommend reading this story and any others by the author.

From the very beginning we meet Marianne McBride, a computer geek who has always been one to follow the rules and do what she is told. Though she is good at what she does, she wants to get out of her shell, and her boss who also happens to be her best friend comes up with the perfect idea. Marianne will be hiding in a cake, and when the right time comes sing Happy Birthday to non other than her best friend's brother. Now that should sound simple enough, but when she is wearing the shortest and tightest dress she has ever seen while singing to her crush, made things a lot worse for Marianne. Needless to say, she does sing to him and after seeing his stunned face, she kisses him and runs away. She bows to never bring that subject again after that day, but secretly hopes that Nick did not recognize her.\n\nThe night of his birthday party will always be in Nick's mind, especially when he gets kissed at the end. Now he can't figure out who she was and it's driving him nuts. To add to his already crazy state-of-mind, his boss gives him the news that he is going to become partner only if he settles down. After receiving the news, he reaches out to her sister in hopes that she'll help him out, and she has the perfect idea of who to match him with. But Nick doesn't want an actual relationship, he only wants a fake fiancee, someone that is going to look nice beside him after meeting other executives. When his sister tells him about Marianne, he is taken back since she is reserved and a workaholic as well. But he doesn't have a choice, and so he agrees. When he proposes the proposition to Marianne, she only asks him to attend a family reunion in return for a six week engagement. Soon the pair is living together, and the more time they spend together, the more they start to like each other. Secrets get revealed as well and soon they both have to face obstacles in order to be together.\n\nI really liked the overall plot of the story, it flowed nicely and we get to understand the characters more after they start to get to know each other. They are both driven by their work, but together they balance each other out. Their chemistry is not instant, at least from Nick's POV, though he is somewhat attracted to her he doesn't find out who she really is right away. We do get to find out a lot of secrets and how they can potentially break the couple apart as well. All in all, the book was a total page-turner for me and quick to read. The ending was perfect, it totally fit with the story and tied things nicely at the end.

It has been a very reliable, useful, and fun camera. I dropped it on asphalt a few weeks back from a height of about 4 feet. The top of the case was pushed up out of position and the shutter button and the function select knob stopped working. I was still able to take photos using the touchscreen. When we got home my husband and I looked up disassembly guides online, pulled the case off, exposed the motherboard and--tada!--we were able to reconnect a loose ribbon cable, so everything is working again. That's double-tuff! I so enjoyed using this camera that I got a higher end 50x optical zoom, so my kid and me aren't vying to use the WB250.\n\nThe smart features on this camera are, to me, quite impressive: isolating a single figure in a video and stopping all other background motion; best face, where you can pick from a number of shots taken before and after the designated shot; and the ability to connect to a smart phone and transfer images or use it as a remote control for shots you are also in.\n\nThe photos look reasonably crisp and clean and the flash seems adequate for fairly close images. It definitely isn't the blinding Minolta flash I had back in the early 1980s, but I'm not even sure those things are still legal (I joke). It's nice to finally have a digital camera that can accept manual settings and has usable optical zoom. I really wanted something to take decent photos and video that our family could enjoy many years down the road and I think this fills the bill for me.\n\nThis camera has 2 MP less than the newer version, but the newer camera does not have a rechargeable battery, which I very much preferred. Why they \"improved\" the rechargeable battery feature away in the newer model is a total mystery to me. That was actually what made me decide to get this camera rather than the newer model.\n\nMy only complaint is that it is sometimes a bit slow to take a photo after pushing the button. Not sure what's up with that. Otherwise, this camera has met and exceeded our needs and expectations. (Update: the slowdown after taking a photo is probably caused by the slow write speed SD card I used .)\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

That is what happens to the protagonist in Jook and Gypsies by Shirley A. Martin.\n\nAfter the death of her mother and grandparents, Susannah Henika meets her father for the first time when social workers take her to live with him. Of course, there is the evil stepmother, but she is incidental to the story, except perhaps to be a wedge between the father and daughter.\n\nAfter Susannah moves in with her father, see meets a strange woman, Madalina Sadrinovic  who introduces her to Luca, her brother. As the story unfolds, we discover that the Sadrinovic family are good werewolves fighting bad ones, and both types of werewolves are seeking Susannah.\n\nMs. Martin creates a realistic teenager, one who confides in her best friend as she tries to understand how she fits in the world. But even her best friend does not know Susannahs secrets, which she herself does not understand until she learns about her gypsy ancestors.\n\nLittle by little, the author reveals the secrets, and the plot explodes. There is a lot of sex and gore, vis-a-vis the rogue werewolves. If either of these is offensive this is not a book for you.\n\nThere are a lot of characters, some better developed than others. Since Jook and Gypsies is volume 1 in the Bloodline Gypsy series, we may see these characters come into play in future books. Otherwise, Im not sure what their purpose was. Once such character is Billie, Susannahs ski board instructor. Other than to highlight what Susannahs life might have been had she not become involved with the werewolves or to accentuate what she left behind, I see no purpose for this character.\n\nThe book just ends with the story unresolved. Having vested time in reading this lengthy book, I would have preferred a resolution (does she escape or not) and then a cliff-hanger. Instead, the story continues in the second volume.\n\nThe story and characters are developed well enough that I am willing to overlook the editing errors and purchase the second book. I just have to find out what happens to the Jook and Gypsies.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

And no, I could have cared less because I've never read any of them before so I was as happy as a pig in......\n\nSomething Wild:\nAnnie Simon has just left her abusive boyfriend. She had enough one day and grabbed what she could and ran. Along the way to the Black Cat Casino, where she's hoping to make enough to fund another future, she makes a meandering trail through the various parks and scenic trails along the East Coast. Also along the way she picked up a fan. An obsessed fan, who keeps cruising along her wake on a gorgeous Harley. Jacob Kerr has been following Annie, just trying to get her to talk to him. When he finally does get past her prickly defenses, he comes on hard and fast, dominant and possessive. He's relentless in forcing Annie to accept him and despite her reticence, her defenses don't stand a chance.\n\nThis little novella came on incredibly strong. Jacob Kerr was almost too much man for me. I think I would have needed a restraining order on this guy. I don't see how he was ever going to let her go. Kind of creepy, but since it all worked out, I guess it was good. The visceral image of a guy punching through a wall has always intimidated me so maybe that's why I was almost afraid of Jacob. He's definitely hot and his sexuality is smokin, but he kind of freaked me out. Plus, Annie was already running from a scary guy to begin with. :/\n\nMeltdown:\nJane Duvall is a headhunter and she's on the hunt for Mr. Finley from Crowne Royale. Using her best acting skills, she lies her way past the receptionist but when she gets there, Mr. Finley isn't in, but wouldn't she rather meet the CEO of the company, Michael MacNamara? Trapped, Jane has no choice but to brazen it out and when she meets Michael, their instantaneous chemistry is palpable and electrifying. What started out as just instant chemistry, quickly became obsession in the best kind of way.\n\nI loved this one. Something Wild was the appetizer and Meltdown was an absolutely delicious main course. I just sank my teeth into this gorgeous hunk of man and I loved Jane, too. Mac was obsessive without being scary and his sexuality made me melt. His attempts to win Jane over was incredibly sweet and romantic and I wish this could have been a full length novel. I loved it and I recommend you read this anthology for this novella alone.\n\nTouch Me:\nJonah has alot going on right now and when his secretaries and doctor recommend he get some R&R, Tess Langley is the lucky massage therapist who gets to rub her special massage oil all over him. His bid for relaxation immediately backfires when he gets a good look at Tess and as she turns him down time and time again, he comes up with a different strategy. Since gentle coaxing isn't working, he tries manipulation and luring. He sets up a house party that is void of other guests and there he stages his seduction.\n\nWow! And not in a good way. I've never met a more b*tchy heroine before. True, she's got issues and she's been dumped on and belittled by a truly horrendous mother but still. I did not like Tess and she did not deserve someone as wonderful as Jonah. The only thing she should have had coming was a lump of coal in her stocking. Grrrr. It was also not believable that one day she would fly off the handle about every little comment and then the next day be completely past it and secure in Jonah's love, but whatever.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Almost.\n\nI was afraid that with Faefever being the third book it would be an info dump of exposition. While it's true we get a lot of information, Karen Marie Moning tells it in a gripping, taut and thoroughly surprising way. Mac, Barrons and V'lane are still searching for the Book aka The Beast. They are still not trusting each other or sharing information and it's so silly. If only the three of them could sit down and talk, openly and honestly, it would prevent so many problems, but KMM writes a funny scene that dispenses with that idea pretty quick. It seems both V'lane and Barrons have a long and nasty history and although Mac is dying to know, they aren't sharing. It's almost as if they are fighting over her and the first one in her pants, wins. Since Mac can't trust anyone, she spreads her eggs throughout all the baskets she can find, including Inspector O'Duffy, Christian MacKeltar and Dani, one of her fellow sidhe-seers. Derrick O'Bannion makes an appearance, making nasty threats about the upcoming Halloween, and he's seen with an aquaintance of Mac and Barrons that's sure to have repercussions in later books. The Lord Master also makes an appearance. He's trying to wheedle his way into her good graces, just like all the other men in her life right now. This encounter prompts her to ask Barrons for help in resisting Voice, which allows for some interesting byplay and a powerful scene between the two of them. Barrons becomes a much more aggressive, brutal and enigmatic character than ever before while V'lane, however, turns into almost a pussycat. He's toned down the death-by-sex vibe and Mac even turns to him for bodyguard service. While this book has a dark feel to it, it's also arguably one of the funniest offerings in the Fever series to date. Mac and Barrons continue to hunt but she's afraid deep down, of whether or not she can trust Barrons to do the right thing if they find the Book. Improvising the best she can, she leads the men on wild goose chases, until one night, she can't hide her reaction from Barrons and they come the closest they've ever been to the book and Barrons' own arrogance and certainty is put to the test. When that proves futile, the only thing they can do now is help shore up the walls between Man and Faery, which means joining forces with the MacKeltars. Barrons journeys to Scotland to lend his own special brand of Druid magic and Mac stays in Dublin to try and help with her fellow sidhe-seers as they perform their own rituals. It becomes a race against time to keep the walls up and the horrors of the Unseelie out of the world of Man.\n\nThere isn't much to actually outline in ways of story except to say that everyone is in kind of a holding pattern. They are just looking for the book and waiting for Halloween, when Barrons and the MacKeltars attempt to rebuild the walls between Man and Faery. We learn a lot more about the sidhe-seer organization and the Hallows, both Seelie and Unseelie, plus the Unseelie King. Christian MacKeltar steps into the ring as another possible love interest for Mac, creating a wary, prickly threesome and speaking of threesomes, wow! I think it fair to add in my review that there is a three way gang rape in the end of the book with Mac as the victim. It was not pleasant but just know that in this reader's humble opinion, it didn't bother me in the slightest. Some people will compare this to an orgy a la Laurell K. Hamilton and it wasn't. It was not graphic or exploitive. It was pertinent to the story and to be honest, I felt like this was a long time coming. With all that talk about death-by-sex, it was time for an example.\n\nAhhh, Barrons. Mac says to herself during her many musings that she has apologized and made excuses for him in the past and it's true. He's enigmatic and evasive to say the least and in this book he's down right brutal. He lets go with his domineering, dark side a lot more in Faefever and I still think he's hot as hell. Some might say he crossed a line with Mac with his Voice coaching but like Mac said, she was just fooling herself as to his true nature. The layers are being stripped away and I for one, loved it. We'll just have to wait and see what lies underneath that impenetrable cloak of his.\n\nI really enjoyed Faefever. We get some more glimpses of the MacKeltars in this one and Christian is shaping up to be worthy of the name Keltar and with his long dark hair and golden eyes, remind you of anyone? Once again Karen Marie Moning teases and torments us with innuendoes between Mac and Barrons. I also felt there was an intriguing clue about Barrons' origins tucked away in plain sight. Oooo. Time will tell. While unfortunately there isn't much going on during this book, the humor and tension is still very much alive in it. The ending ramped up my excitement for the fourth book, Dreamfever and ahhhhh!

Although he was not a particularly extraordinary man, his extra limb notwithstanding, the interest in this story lies not in the fictional biography of Blashette himself as much as in the minutiae at the margins of his life. Author Mark Dunn, who wrote the whimsical word-play novel \"Ella Minnow Pea,\" has pushed the boundaries of fiction even farther with \"Ibid.\" As Dunn states in the acknowledgments, he sought to \"step wide of the narrative box\" by crafting a story solely through the use of footnotes. As constrained as the idea sounds, it actually works.\n\nThrough the footnotes with their interviews, excerpts from articles and diaries, and accounts of historical events, the reader becomes acquainted not only with Blashette, but also with his family, his friends, and society at large. Blashette managed to rub elbows with such celebrities as Rudolph Valentino, Lou Gehrig, and Dylan Thomas. He was placed at the scene of numerous historical events, both well known and obscure. Thus, Dunn asserts, \"History can be more fun than dry facts and dates.\"\n\nThe silly-sounding names and titles cited in the footnotes, as well as selections of atrociously composed poems, songs, and essays, spoof their more dry and scholarly real-life counterparts.  The tongue-in-cheek details go off on bizarre tangents. In a parody of Wilde's Dorian Gray, an account is given of Blashette having commissioned his deceased true love's portrait and then having it modified every year to age her appearance. In another reference, a description is given of a friend's membership in a small Christian sect that believed Jesus had a dog that accompanied Him as He preached. There is an amusing account of a devastating squirrel migration in 1826 that destroyed crops.  Another humorous segue is a court deposition, recorded during a lawsuit against Blashette's deodorant company, that is written in the form of a play script,\n\nWhere Dunn will go from here is anyone's guess. Will he perhaps try a palindromic novel, or one written without any letter \"e\"?  Time will tell. In the meanwhile, enjoy this playful story.\n\nEileen Rieback\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Lehrer provides his own introduction, as well as hilarious introductions to each of the songs. The album also includes two bonus tracks with songs that Lehrer wrote and performed for \"The Electric Company\" in 1972, and even though they were created to teach children to read, they still contain his trademark creativity and humor.\n\nThis album contains some of Lehrer's earliest material. Although it is less politically oriented than his later songs, it is every bit as satirical. The songs parody many styles of music including love songs, folk ballads, and football fight songs. As Lehrer puts it himself in the introduction to \"I Wanna Go Back To Dixie\": \"Well, what I like to do on formal occasions like this is to take some of the various types of songs that we all know and presumably love, and, as it were, to kick them when they're down.\" Many of these songs are shockingly macabre or raunchy, and considering when they were performed, they were well ahead of their time.  Even the liner notes are funny, and although they are not attributed to Lehrer, I have the feeling he had a hand in their authorship.\n\nThis is a short album, barely over a half hour long. I suppose this is because Lehrer wrote only about fifty songs in all before dropping out of songwriting to teach mathematics, so his songs are sparingly rationed out among a few CDs. But good things come in small packages. In my humble opinion, Tom Lehrer is one of the greatest musical satirists, and I highly recommend this album.\n\nEileen Rieback\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.44}, {"id": "21992", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nOverall, a pretty good book.

As a non-expert I am not qualified to review it on technical grounds, but I was intrigued by the authors' claim to require of readers only minimal computational and mathematical background. In their introduction they state:\n\n\"This book aims to describe such recent achievements of complexity theory in the context of more classical results. It is intended to serve both as a textbook and as a reference for self-study. This means it must simultaneously cater to many audiences, and it is carefully designed with that goal in mind. We assume essentially no computational background and very minimal mathematical background, which we review in Appendix A.\"\n\nI thought it would be an interesting experiment to see just how much I could learn about the topic just from the book itself. I did succeed in getting quite a bit more than I expected from dipping into it at various points, but in the end I was reminded of P.F. Strawson's remark that \"There is no shallow end to the philosophical pool.\" The computational complexity pool is similarly configured.\n\nThe fundamental background for this field was set up in the 1930's by logicians such as Alan Turing and Alonzo Church whose work gave the answer to what constitutes a computable function. Turing described a simple type of abstract machine and showed that such a machine could compute any computable function.\n\nWith the question of what is theoretically computable decisively settled, the question turns to what is computable efficiently--that is, within an amount of time determined by the size of the input raised to some power.\n\nThe central and unsolved problem of computational complexity is whether the class P of decision problems which can be efficiently solved (that is, computed by a Turing machine in polynomial time) is the same as the class NP of problems whose solution can be efficiently verified. Verification is generally a much simpler task than finding a solution, which might require long searches. The authors do an excellent job of explaining the philosophical significance of this problem as well as its practical importance. As they put it, if P = NP, \"then the world would be mostly a computational Utopia.\"\n\nEven for the non-technical reader there are many interesting and delightful things in this book and my (non-technical) guess would be that with it is going to become the standard reference and textbook in the field. Whether the general reader will find it penetrable is a much different question, and I suspect she won't. The reason is not the fault of the book--it is extremely well-written--but of human psychology: new ideas take a while to become familiar enough that you can work with them.\n\nThe authors, who have done such a marvelous job with this book aimed at the professional audience in computational complexity, could do us all a great service by writing another book aimed at a general audience. Clearly they have the knowledge and the writing skills to make this field more broadly accessible and the topics involved are fascinating and important.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I miss understood the meaning of \"magnetic base\" in the description.  I thought it meant the bits were held in place by magnets, but it means the bottom is magnetic and the whole thing will stick to any ferrous metal.  The bits are retained just by a pressure fit, which is a very little bit too tight, but definitely not loose and not too difficult to remove.  The magnets are strong enough to hold the entire unit to the side of my toolbox but the base is smooth plastic and it slides down the side of the box. I'm going to put something sticky or grippy in between and I'm sure it will stay in place.  The socket adapters are the weak point in this set, but thats fine for me because I'm using them in a bit driver and don't need them.  The reason they are not so great is they way they retain the bits.  The 1/4 inch adapter uses a spring to grip both sides of the bit and I don't see it staying in there for very long.  The 3/8 inch adapter uses a detent pin to hold the bits in place similar to most nicer ratchets, but the difference is the pressure on the detent ball is applied with a thin band of spring steel that wraps around the socket and I can see that breaking or getting dirt under it and sliding off.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I put my phone in it, lengthened the lanyard and put it around my neck while we loaded fishing gear.

Around 4000 years old, Mencheres is one of the oldest and most powerful vampires on the planet. In a previous book, he shared his powers with Bones and they merged their lines, becoming co-rulers. Mencheres' estranged wife Patra was the enemy in one of the previous books. Mencheres has been portrayed as a mysterious and interesting character, and I've looked forward to reading his story.\n\nIn Eternal Kiss of Darkness, Mencheres faces off against an old enemy Radje who wants to kill him and take his powers. But it's not an upfront fight--Radje uses many underhanded methods which makes for an engrossing plot full of twists and turns. We get to see old favorites like Bones, Cat and Vlad, as well as a new one in Kira, Mencheres' love interest. Kira begins the story as a human private detective, who is thrown into the supernatural world due to an act of kindness on her part.\n\nMencheres and Kira are both great characters. Frost did a much better job with character development in this book than in the last book First Drop of Crimson. I felt like I got to know them and connected with them. Kira is strong, smart, sassy, caring, and overall appealing as a lead heroine--a good partner for Mencheres. I enjoyed learning more about Mencheres and his ancient Egyptian background. Although this book wasn't as sexy as the Cat/Bones books, the romantic relationship was well developed and fun to read about. And I liked the explantations given about Mencheres' role in the previous Gregor/Cat mess. Some of his previous decisions made me question him, but the explanations in this book made me understand those decisions better.\n\nAlthough it started a little slow, this book picked up speed and ended up being a great read. It's an entertaining mix of suspense, action, humor, romance and mystery. With such a big character in Mencheres, I had worried this book would be hard to pull off. That's happened recently in some other paranormal romance series like Dark Hunters (Acheron) and Breeds (Jonas). Some fans felt those books didn't live up to their expectations because the characters had such big roles. Luckily, that wasn't the case with Eternal Kiss of Darkness. Mencheres story and his love interest lived up to my expecations for his character. Great job Ms. Frost!\n\nOne key area I would have liked improvement was the ending.

The Cat and Bones that I came to know and love in the other books were missing. Instead of being strong and sassy, Cat was grumpy, whiny and drinking too much. She didn't kick much a@@ like she did in previous books and instead seemed to be mostly hiding from problems and drowning in misery. Bones was ugly and nonsupportive, and generally noncommunicative. The few times they got together in the book didn't make up for all of the bad times.

The fit is great.  Easy to install.  The rubber inserts lasted only a few months, sadly.  I thought I would be smart and find replacement inserts like I used to for the OEM blades, but guess what, these inserts are nonstandard (see right photo with rubber insert surrounding metal core).  I'm trying for a work around, but boy am I angry that the wiper blade industry is forcing us to replace perfectly good wiper mechanisms for $30-40 or more, rather than replace the $7 insert.  What a waste of resources and money!  BMW has stopped selling inserts, which to me (a BMW fanboy) is infuriating.\n\nQuick primer on wiper inserts.  There are apparently 4 different wiper profiles (cross sections), described as A-D.  The \"D\" is known as a \"square claw\" and comes in various widths, typically 6mm for shorter blades (up to 22\") and 8mm for 26.\"\n\nTo use the Trico refills with these blades you order the Trico 47-600 6mm Break to Fit Narrow Refill - 16\" to 22\" (Sold as Pair) rubber insert and they slide right in, after you pry apart the end \"claws\" which are crimped tightly around the original rubber insert.

You not only have to pry apart the end claw to release the rubber insert, but you have to use two needle nose pliers (see left photo) to spread apart each claw a by 2mm (1mm each side) to fit the 8mm insert.  This will make the claws slightly trapezoidal, but don't worry, they will work.  Make sure the metal insert \"ribbons\" are lined up flush with each other and slide the insert in to the wiper blade. Voila! you have $7 refills for both sides.

Hydrogyn provides a unique feel to the Alternative/Hard Rock scene, and their sound has truly grown on me to provide a listening experience rock fans may come to appreciate if given enough time and exposure to the group.\n\nHydrogyn is lead by their female vocalist Julie Westlake, a \"Bombshell\" looking blond with singing talents to backup her looks.  She's every bit as talented as she is sexy, something that is quite rare in the music world.  Her pipes explode with enthusiasm, hitting notes perfectly, and keeping rhythm quite well.\n\nThe album jumps off with a bang.  \"Rejection\" is a well done, fast paced track that showcases the band's musical skills.  The guitar work is well structured, with great sounding, heavy riffs, and great drum patterns.  The solo that comes in halfway through the song adds further intensity to this opening track, setting the stage for the remainder of the album.  Julie's voice is almost angelic, rolling smoothly over the guitar work.\n\nFrom here, the next track \"On and On\" slows things down a bit.  This song is much slower, and more along the lines of Alternative Rock, beginning with Julie slowly whispering before going into the transition singing of the track.  The guitar and drums kick in, upping the tempo and rhythm beautifully, then slowing down again.  The tempo changes occur so naturally, fitting the band's style and Julie's vocals like a glove.\n\nThe album has great songs, from start to finish, but stand out tracks are plenty and include: \"On and On\", and the beautifully done \"Candles Light Your Face\".  These tracks slow things down, and showcase Julie's voice to a higher degree than other tracks on \"Deadly Passions\".  \"Candles Light Your Face\" is a slow song that consists of acoustic guitar work, which complements the vocals unlike any other song on the album.  The slower songs seem to allow Julie to use her voice in a much smoother, and harmonic manner.\n\n\"Deadly Passions\" continues to provide a transition between Hard Rock and Alternative Rock, and manages to keep a good balance between the styles.  The instrument work remains consistent, and the vocals and lyrics provide another dimension to the band that is hard to come by.  Female fronted bands always provide a unique sound that I have grown to love, but there's something about the sound of Julie's voice that has me coming back over and over again.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

From more hardened metal fans, to females, to people just getting into the rock genre, their style of music is open enough and friendly enough to the ears that almost anyone can get into their music.  With each passing album, the band has tended to lean more towards a softer, more alternative sound than their previous releases.\n\nAs the band has matured, so as their sound.  \"Life Starts Now\" embraces a much softer side to Three Days Grace, while still managing to bring out some great hard rock songs from time to time as well.  The album gets things started with \"Bitter Taste\".  The track contains a great hook and melody that may have listeners singing along and tapping their feet to the rhythm and lyrics in no time.  Whereas this track embodies the feelings one may have during a tough breakup, the following track \"Break\" leans in the opposite direction.  \"Break\" is a great song with a pretty positive message about making the best out of what you have and taking advantage of every situation you get.\n\nFrom here, the songs continue to echo the same types of feelings, and the toe tapping resumes throughout the album's play-length.  Even the slower songs, such as \"World So Cold\" and \"Someone Who Cares\" have enough melody and rhythm going on that it's sure to entrap the listener and have them singing the tracks long after the album is over.\n\nStand out tracks include: \"Someone Who Cares\" and \"Last to Know\" due to the fact that they stray so much from the remainder of the album's formula.  Following a much slower, soothing sound in both instances, each of these two tracks is unique and worth listening to multiple times.  At first, the departure of sound may be a turn off to some for these two tracks, but after several playbacks, the style stands out from the rest of the songs found on \"Life Starts Now\".\n\nThe majority of the album tends to lean towards the subject matters of love and the loss of love.  Tracks like \"Bitter Taste\", \"Last to Know\" and \"Someone Who Cares\" talk about love and how losing love or trying to regain it can be a difficult task.  Other songs such as \"Break\" and \"Life Starts Now\" tend to have much \"peppier\" tempos and subject matters when compared to the majority of the tracks on the album.\n\nOverall, however, the album is a great listen from start to finish.  Whether you're looking for a new alternative album to add to your collection, or are just getting into the genre, Three Days Grace's \"Life Starts Now\" is a great album to purchase.

He advised Presidents and politicians, wrote best-selling books, taught economics at Harvard, appeared on TV, and served as the U.S. Ambassador to India.  Nevertheless, mainstream economists looked down their noses at him.  They scoffed at his sweeping generalizations.  They questioned his technical prowess, noting that his books had no math.  Many suspected that he was a \"mere sociologist\" masquarading as an economist.\n\nThese critics may have been jealous of Galbraith's literary fame and towering public profile.  In any event, they certainly misconstrued his significance in American intellectual life.  Galbraith's great gift as a thinker was his razor-sharp eye for cant.  He knew where economic ideas came from, how they supported vested interests, and where they diverged from the plain facts of everyday life -- and he conveyed these lessons to educated general readers in elegant prose.  In the end, he may have been a gadfly and critic, not a model builder -- but so what?  If mainsteam economists taught us how to think about markets, Galbraith taught us how to think about mainstream economics.\n\n\"The Affluent Society\" is one of his masterpieces.  Written in the 1950s, ideas fly from its pages, touching on everything from Ricardian economics to oligopolies and inflation.  The central idea, however, is arresting.  Galbraith argued that modern economics was forged in the austere world of the 19th century, when national economies struggled simply to feed and clothe their populations.  Sensible at the time, the core assumptions of economics were carried over to a different century facing a different set of problems.  In the 20th century, supermarkets bursted with unnecessary soaps and cereals, car models changed every year, and billions of advertising dollars were spent on campaigns to convince consumers that they needed items they never even knew they wanted.\n\nGalbraith argued that, with the problem of scarcity more or less solved, society was free to loosen the connection between income and labor, and to spend more money on public goods such as schools, hospitals, and clean air.  He rejected as anachronistic the objection that such measures would reduce economic efficiency by mandating higher taxes or rewarding idleness:  what was the value of having an efficient economic system if the goods it produced answered no urgent human needs?  Galbraith thought that society should focus on the development of human capacities and the building of decent communities and workplaces, and not fret unduly over allocative efficiency.\n\nGalbraith was wrong about many things, but he was always thought-provoking and mind-expanding.  The continuing force of \"The Affluent Society\" will be clear to anyone who reflects on the crazy popularity of SUVs or tallies up the money we lavish on pets -- in a day and age when American cats get better medical care than most African children, it's safe to say that the supply side problem has finally been solved (at least for us and our pets).  The book should be read by all serious students of economics or 20th century American society, and it belongs on any bookshelf of social criticism next to the works of Thorstein Veblen and C. Wright Mills.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

He didn't express himself in math, he made sweeping generalizations about society (not always backed by strong evidence), and he freely drew on the insights of history, sociology, and politics, paying little heed to interdisciplinary boundaries.  For that reason, many economists looked down their noses at him.  And for that reason, his books are still in print and enjoyed by readers decades after they first appeared.  Galbraith was more than an economist.  He was a great social critic, a great debunker of cant, and a superb prose stylist.  He was the Veblen of post-World War II America.\n\nHe was at the top of his powers when he wrote \"The New Industrial State\" in the 1960s.  The book came as close as anything did to summarizing the Galbraithian \"system.\"  Parts of it are outdated, such as the assertion that financial markets have little influence on big corporations, or the strained argument that the American and Soviet economic systems were \"converging.\"  Other parts, however, are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago, such as the critique of advertising and consumerism, or the analysis of how our gigantic defense industry shapes policy and influences the Pentagon.  In a time when the Federal Reserve is bailing out banks and scrambling to protect the economy from the miscalculations of the financial sector, it's good to be reminded that the private sector looks to government to keep the economy on a even keel, no matter what the official ideology of the private sector may be.\n\nMost of all, \"The New Industrial State\" displayed Galbraith's genius for stepping back and asking big questions.  These continue to haunt economics, even though textbook writers bury them in footnotes.  Why DO we treat GDP is an adequate measure of social welfare?  Why DO we choose to consume higher productivity in the form of goods rather than leisure?  Why DOES our pedagogy emphasize \"perfect competition\" when the economy is dominated by big firms?  Why DO we assume that workers and managers are motivated solely by pecuniary considerations?  And on and on.\n\n\"The New Industrial State\" is a trove of intellectual riches, expressed in masterful and witty prose.  Every undergraduate economics student should read it.  So should every educated citizen.  It's a 20th century classic.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.81}, {"id": "211027", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI'm kind of glad that I read Janice Erlbaum's second memoir, Have You Found Her, first.

This is a stand alone story of Porsche.  It didn't need to bring back any other character because the story developed all on it's own.  How this young girl (although I did feel she was a little TOO young for decisions she made) found the way to fight for herself and her family.  Really, the story outlined what it was like in her household, fighting to be seen and loved by the family members she cherished.  Porsche fought hard only so she could get back to 'her safe haven', because what she had was better than nothing.  She didn't understand why her family wasn't there fighting for her, trying to save her, get her back.  And she knew if it had been her older sister someone would have done something to save her.  Porsche felt she was thrown away and her life was dedicated to making that not true. It's funny that because it wasn't like Sister Souljah's earlier books that this one was 'less than'. Simply not true.  It was full of poetry and symmetry, a world of pain, loneliness and fear.  This little girl was made to be self sufficient, to rely on her own wits, to 'be like' those she admired so they would accept her, bring her back into the only world she knew.  Not only was she disappointed over and over again, she continued to fight for that love when the odds were completely against her.  Most of what she survived happened at an unbelievably young age but it didn't diminish the raw pain and desperation of wanting to belong, to be loved.  I think Sister Souljah did another outstanding job, creating another unique story that draws you in and leaves you wanting more.  She's an excellent writer, a masterful storyteller and A Deeper Love Inside is proudly sitting on my bookshelf with other fierce authors!

Unlike the purists, I don't mind the foray, or her takes on Splish Splash and I Aint Gonna Cry Tonight, since they are yet again proof of Barbra's eclectic choices. However for me, the pluses of this album are the beautiful Lee Holdridge orchestrated arrangments of the ballads, and the almost tragic idea that this was the voice that we could have had doing the film of Evita. When Robert Stigwood had director Ken Russell on board, he wanted Barbra, but she turned it down, primarily because she disliked Don't Cry for Me Argentina, but also because she was in pre-production on Yentl. One would hardly want to deny Barbra fulfilling her long cherished Yentl dream. And one could also dismiss the idea that at her age of 37 she was too old to play Eva Peron. But at 27 she was considered too young to play Dolly Levi in Hello, Dolly but she was cast because of her voice, and this !is the voice that Evita deserved. (Barbra's vocals for her next album, Guilty, were lesser, for her at least). Not to mention that the role of Evita suited Barbra's androgynous persona, and that the she resembles the real Eva Peron. The only redemptive element of being eventually saddled with Alan Parker directing Madonna, is Tim Rice returning to Andrew Lloyd Webber to write You Must Love Me, similar to how Jerry Herman wrote Love is Only Love for Barbra's Dolly. Oh well. Of this album, it can be noted that Barbra cowrote the title track, in one of her rare songwriting efforts, but my favourite here is On Rainy Afternoons, a never repeated exploration of Lalo Schifrin material. It is said at the time that Streisand was outbid by Richard Clayderman for the rights to an album of Schifrin love songs. This, and her pass on Evita, is perhaps too much to bear.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

If a lot of these songs are of lesser material, this is nothing new for Streisand, since her choice of material has always been eclectic, even in her early recording days, and perhaps a reminder of the attitude of her mentor Barry Dennen, who was more interested in the singer drawing attention to herself rather than subjugating to the song. (This argument was sweetly defended by saying she was \"acting\" the songs). Examples of this mentality here are One More Night and Deep in the Night, where the greatest pleasure is in hearing her histrionic climbs. Honey, Can I Put on Your Clothes, prefigures Barbra's transvestite interest in Yentl, though it's telling that she got the greenlight for Yentl at the cost of Peters. The title track is probably the strongest song melodically, since it uses her favoured three act structure. Her rethinking of Tomorrow, a reminder of the reinterpreting of standards a la Happy Days are Here Again, with her version understated yet still emotional. And her solo You Don't Bring Me Flowers, evidence that Neil Diamond was never needed, and also why she is considered to have one of the greatest voices of the twentieth century.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.28}, {"id": "211042", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI liked the book even if at times I didn't like the female lead.

The is particularly true if you drink your English Breakfast tea in bags or pouches (you owe it to yourself to get a good infuser like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Adagio-Teas-ingenuiTEA-Bottom-Dispensing-Teapot/dp/B000FPN8TK\n\nSome reviewers have complained that this tea comes as mostly dust and fannings, but I did not find that to be the case with my package.  It definitely contained more dust/fannings than some of the finer grade Assam I buy from a local tea shop, but I'd attribute that more to the fact that it is being mail-ordered in small quantities and not being graded again after receipt.  (see photo for the character of my batch at the bottom of the bag once I'd consumed most of the tea in the bag).\n\nAs to the flavor profile and character, I should first say that my taste preference is on the extreme side of earthy/malty with as little astringency (tannin) as possible.  I drink my tea with milk and agave syrup as a general rule.  My typical favorites are certain Assam teas (which I typically brew heavy but short) and Irish or Scottish Breakfast blends.  I also generally enjoy good quality Keemun and Dianhong teas.\n\nMy general reaction to this particular tea blend is that it stands up well to a heavier brew (the way I like) but it is very sensitive to over-brewing.  The directions say 3-5 minutes, but I found that a 3 minute brew at 195 to be just at the edge of my preference for astringency, but having a great full body, malty character, and more exotic/floral notes than a typical Assam or Breakfast blend.  The smell of the dried leaves almost seems like there is some bergamot (what gives Earl Grey its distinct flavor) but there is no mention of any additives to this tea blend, so I have to assume that it is coming from one of the more exotic varieties of tea used in this blend.  Speaking of additives, I've poked through the leaf mix and there is nothing in this blend besides tea leaves, so please ignore reviewers that mention bits of citrus or other additives - this looks to be a pure tea blend (and this is also stated by the producer).\n\nIn summary, if you like a good hearty cup of tea and are looking for something with a bit more complexity and a different flavor profile, but still with the maltiness and caffeine kick of a good Breakfast tea, give this one a try.

Truly 4 channels, and very easy to fly.  Also, hard to break!  Just don't lose your tail propeller, my original kept falling off when I would crash, but I replaced it with a new one and it stays on just fine now.\n\nUPDATE 8-18-2013:  I found a GREAT upgrade for this helicopter.  You'll notice that the tail motor just isn't strong enough and will blow out on you during throttle spikes, when flying in wind, and when trying to execute a turn while gliding sideways.  I had this Helimax Axe CP 100 tail motor laying around, and put it on my V911 after I burned out my V911 tail motor by running about 10 batteries in a row (the motor got HOT and stopped spinning).\n\nWhat you'll need:\n-Helimax Axe CP 100 tail motor (I got the whole tailshaft with motor for about 4 bucks from tower)\n-Basic soldering iron\n-Superglue\n-X-acto knife\n-Small wire cutter/stripper (can  also use use the razor blade to cut/strip, and use the soldering iron to burn wire insulation off)\n-Any kind of tape for the first test flight (before you permanently seal solder joints\n\nHere are some basic instructions:\n\n-Cut old V911 tail motor wires right at the motor (so you have as much as possible to work with)\n-Cut new Helimax tail motor wires where the little splice is (where it goes from the Red/Black wires coming out of the motor and connects to the shiny wires that run down the tail shaft)\n-Carefully strip the ends of all wires, and tin them up with some fresh solder (by tin them up I mean expose about 0.5-1mm of copper wire, and feed it some heat and solder so its nice and silver and ready to stick to other solder - If you skip this step and try to solder bare copper wires together, it will be more difficult).\n-To remove old tail motor from V911, you need to pry up on the back of the motor to get it past the little lip that retains it in the V911 tail.  NOTE:  This little lip needs to be carefully shaved off with your X-Acto blade - The Helimax motor is slightly longer and will not fit without this lip being cut off.  Shave it off until it is perfectly flat with the dished section that the motor sits in.\n-Once you've shaved the lip off, you can easily slide the Helimax motor into the V911 tail.  Test fit it and make sure it sits flat against the housing.\n-Once you've test fitted the tail motor, and are happy with its orientation (making sure new motor wires are able to reach the wires coming out of V911 tail), remove the motor, put a drop of superglue in the tail, in the black plastic dished-out section where the motor sits.  Now slide the motor in, AT AN ANGLE at first, so you don't accidentally bulldoze the superglue with the end of the motor.\n-Once the motor is all the way in, squeeze it against he tail real hard and hold it there for a minute to let the superglue dry.  I used my little pliers to squeeze it, but don't squeeze too hard.  You can dent these motors if you're not careful.\n-Now, solder the wires back together.  I found that getting a little solder on the end of my iron, holding the two wire ends together and then just touching them with the solder ball on my iron worked well.\n-Once I soldered both wires, I used a little bit of tape to protect them for a test flight, then I actually superglued the joints to protect them, and put a tiny rubber band around the motor to hold them stationary.  MAKE SURE they don't short out.  You could blow your circuit board and then you need to spend 5 bucks on another one and wait a week for  it to come from China.\n-I used my original V911 tail blade - Remember this blade goes on one way, if you are spinning out of control, flip the blade so the other side is pointing out.  I might try the Helimax tail blade at some point but I'm very happy with the original right now.\n\nMy V911 ROCKS now!  The tail no longer blows out on me during throttle spikes and while gliding sideways into heavy wind.  I can make excellent spins to the left or right while gliding sideways at any speed.  This upgrade made my little V911 into TWICE the helicopter it was before!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I was just on an epic journey and I don't even think anyone has even noticed how my heart is racing, or my hands are sweaty; I am a torn happy bundle of nerves. Yes I know, torn happy can be considered an oxymoron, but Im like a pendulum swinging from one extreme to the next. I really am completely surprised how this story has unfolded. I enjoyed every moment. Every joy, every sorrow. Every Kiss.\nBo and Half-pint are my new favorite couple. And really they are a package deal, you cant love one without the other, or be mad at one without the other. I will be honest there were times where I wanted to strangle them both. The passion they have for each other quickly diminished those thoughts just as quick as I had them.\nTHE PASSION.\nWOW.\nBordering on being compulsive the feelings of complete adoration between all the characters is what will make you fall in love with this book. Complicate me is a journey, a passage of life between 5 kids; 4 boys and 1 girl, who experience everything together, Their individual firsts becoming another bond that holds them together, whether it be wonder or lust, death, rip your heart out love, or just plain ol growing up, these good ol boys and Alex will sink their claws into you and bring you with them through the swirls and spray of life. M. Robinson makes you have All. Those. Feels. without apology or reservation. She wrote this life tale making me at one point not like her very much because I couldn't handle where she was taking me. Its ok. Ive made peace with her  How could I not? Complicate Me is simply, beautiful. This story makes you realize what you have or what you could have from the things you never knew you wanted. I have two favorite quotes, and from the moment I read them at two very different stages of the story they jump out at me completely encompassing the soul of the story:\n\nSurfing, the boys, and Alex. That was my life.\n\nI didn't need to embrace her for her to feel me; she held my entire world in her arms. ~~ Lucas POV\n\nIf you're looking for that epic tale of friendships and love with every emotion and experience in between, Complicate Me is that story for you.

Oh my words this story was sexy! I completely fell in love with not just the main characters but all the characters. Every single person that was described or that had a voice was intricately woven and needed to make this story one thatll be a long lasting favorite.\n\nDo you believe in fate? Do you believe that there is one person for everyone and one moment that will define who you're supposed to be connected too; who grounds you? For Lake Jones, she met her person at the worst possible timing in the world. Cage Monaghan, the nations star, was it for Lake. They shared one moment in a series of moments only to have life keep them separate.\n\nFast forward years later, Cage fumbles back into Lakes life. Let me say now that I love me some Cage!! He is that guy! That guy whos perfect yet flawed at the same time. You will fall in love with him, hook line and sinker!! The way he loves Lake, oh my, and the teasing he dishes out, so funny!\n\nFunny? I cant even count the many times that I laughed out loud while reading! There were a few times that I went running to my husband to share with him the one liners that just kept me in a fit of giggles.\n\nThrough all the good times while reading I was also brought into some very real struggles these characters had that not only made me hyper aware but also made me sit in awe of the inspiring strength that lay hidden within the words. Once I started reading, I didn't stop. I needed to just be in this world that took me away from reality and I couldn't be happier with my time spent with these characters. The writing was great, the flow was perfect and the conflicts were as real as I sit here writing.  The passion these characters go through to overcome what society deems to label and say whats appropriate in life was awesome to read unfold.\n\nIf you love second chance romances, or if you love stories with a sports theme, One is for you. If you like to have a sexy story that also makes you laugh, One is that book for you. If you love to have your heart beating so fast you don't know how long youve been lost in all the feelings, start reading now. If you love to be surprised at each turn of the page, you will not be disappointed at any one time while reading this beauty!\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.65}, {"id": "211047", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nSimple elegance.

Unfortunately, THonC doesn't live up to that potential. The writing is fractured and hard to follow. The premise is also fractured and hard to follow: are Chester and gang fighting evil, facilitating scientific leaps, or just on a mad dash across the country in search of like-minded crazies? Ultimately I was left wondering if this book is meant to be fun or a religious/social commentary. Definitely not something the son would enjoy.\nThat being said, I must come to the defense of this book in one area. As a social commentary it caught my attention. Have y'all heard of the creep (not a creep, the creep)? `The creep' is what I call the quiet burrowing-in of previously unknown or unacceptable ideas into our common societal mentality. Some examples of the creep include the regularity of interracial dating/marriage, the acceptance of homosexuality, the burgeoning criticism of the overweight and the barely disguised hostility towards the Christian community. What once was taboo has, through quiet, consistent bombardment, become acceptable. While we weren't paying attention. Mr. Rains describes it perfectly as follows: \"Imagine a country invades another country, and they win, and march in and change all the rules and blow up all the buildings. That would be a terrible thing, wouldn't it?\" Chester had heard about this, and seen some bits of old war movies on TV. It did seem rather horrible. Auntie continued. \"But imagine that there is no army, and there is no invasion, no millions of soldiers marching through the streets and firing cannons and blowing things up, but then things are changing anyways. Only nobody notices, because like we said, there is no army. But things are changing, and changing, and soon nobody remembers how it was and what they loved so much, so much that they would have fought a whole army to hold onto it before.\" Books are magic; even the bad ones have something to say.\nI received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

I didn't have high hopes for this knife as a result.\n\nHowever, the handle on this is much thinner, and fits my (very small) hands almost perfectly. It's also a lot smaller than the handle of my Calphalon Contemporary 7\" Santoku, and the combination of handle size and weight makes this a lot more comfortable for prolonged chopping than with the Calphalon. I think the blade is also thinner on this one, which I guess has pros and cons, but so far I've only experienced the pros. Despite the weight and thinness, it feels very sturdy.

With the incredible descriptions, the reader feels like you're THERE with these beautiful souls that Eleanor comes to love as her own family.

It was happy and easy on the eyes.  Moreover, the story started off great with a tone that alluded to a moral message.  It starred a Richie Rich-like protagonist, Candice Wellesley Wellington, Candy for short.  Candy's father was often found too busy to spend time with her so his solution was to shower Candy with rare toys to keep her busy.  One day, Mr. Wellington even managed to find a dinosaur ..yep, Cankersaur Rex, for Candy.  Sweet young Candy of course wanted to train Cank (nickname she called him) to be nice and not bite.  Top that with a jealous boy (Chucky) next door vying for Candy's attention and you've rounded up an interesting crew and potential learning story. However, the ending didn't wow me as I'd hoped.  It was a cute and happy ending but something was off.  Perhaps it wrapped up too quickly and neat and the moral message didn't quite flow with the note that I sensed in the beginning of the book.  My 6yo daughter (she read this too) must have sensed something also because when I asked her how much she liked it, she said it was \"in the middle\".\n\nThe best part of the story that I liked was when Candy's father took the time to help Candy and Chucky find Cank.  It was a moment that a parent can pause to point out to his child that Candy's father really does love Candy and took time for her.

It isn't. This is a wonderfully written, quite serious account of how we look at and think about heads. Larson is an anthropologist by training, and this book is thoroughly researched, but she has a sure and wry touch. This is important because while the book starts with the three-century career of Oliver Cromwell's head, some of the book details what could be excruciatingly boring material, the Victorian academic vogue for collecting skulls, but manages to make it fascinating.\n\nThe book is full of surprises. She considers the shrunken heads at the Pitt Rivers Museum (British) where she's worked. Several aren't human, but the ones that are may be items of commerce, heads of people murdered and shrunken for a lively trade in the jungles, a head for  a gun. The practice of shrinking was originally connected to religious practice, but proved adaptable to the market.\n\nChapter 2 is on trophy heads, and rather wide-ranging. American soldiers took enemy heads in several Asian wars. One photograph shows the crew of MTB 341 grinning while a member of the crew puts a cigarette in the jaws of a Japanese skull, the boat's mascot. This can get sobering, because of an undercurrent of vicious racism--they didn't take German heads. There's a photo, which was a Life Magazine photo of the week in 1944, of a GI's girlfriend peering at a Japanese skull her boyfriend had sent her. More amazing trivia--for more than 300 years there was a Keeper of the Heads who lived in the gatehouse on London Bridge, whose job was to arrange heads and body parts to maximum advantage (the body parts from executed prisoners).\n\nThere's a chapter on deposed heads, of aristocrats via guillotine and other contexts. There was a large market for guillotine portraits, sketched just after decapitation and sold, apparently something like broadsides. A fascination for executions and  other such macabre things was characteristic; she writes that the Paris morgue was among the main attractions of the city, drawing a million visits a year. Larson discusses Madame Tussaud, who had connections so she was able to make death masks just after execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antionette.\n\nChapter 5 is on potent heads, largely those of saints, relics of sanctity. Chapter 6 concerns bone heads, that is skulls, and this is the chapter detailing the amazing Victorian vogue for collecting skulls, many many collections (most of which currently reside in museums), and largely for the study of racial differences--the \"science\" was closely connected with phrenology (which largely was concerned with living heads, judging character by shape and bump). Chapter 8 considers living heads. This is of two kinds, the decapitation and freezing of living heads in the hope of becoming alive again at some point in the future, and of what fleeting consciousness is there in heads just decapitated.\n\nYou don't have to read the book straight through as I did. The chapters can be read separately. I think that the most interesting are the first chapter with Cromwell's head, and Chapter 2, on trophy heads.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It's sort of a collection of essays about bad clowns.\n\nRadford starts off with a bit of history, and he puts together in the clown category some aspects I would not have thought of, but that make sense. The Punch and Judy puppet shows of course feature Punch's gratuitous violence to all and sundry, but I would not have seen a connection with the figure of Harlequin in commedia del'arte or the ancient business of kings having fools and jesters who can get away with criticism by dint of their defined role. Then there's the British clown Joseph Grimaldi (1778-1837) whose troubled life apparently is reflected in his memoirs, edited by one Charles Dickens, and Dickens seems to have much to do with the development of the bad clown trope (I must have missed those novels).\n\nOther chapters address many related topics. Chapter 4 discusses irrational fear of clowns. Chapter 5 examines bad clowns in ink, largely comics. I had never heard of comics specializing in bad clowns and evil clown characters. Based on Radford's reporting, I'd say it is an acquired taste. Chapter 6 looks at \"bad clowns of the screen\" including film but also television (and now one assumes in social media), including The Simpsons. Chapter 7 discusses bad clowns in music--apparently bad clowns show up in contemporary music of the sort older adults like me are blissfully unaware of. Chapter 8 discusses clown porn--discusses, with no examples or illustrations, thankfully.\n\nChapter 9 covers creepy clowns and killer clowns, including some real killers. Chapter 10 covers activist clowns, clowns who use their humr and techniques for partisan views, which must hearken back to court jesters. Chapter 11 covers dip clowns, persons in clown costume suspended above a water tank; these insult passersby to the point they buy several baseball tosses to dunk the clown. Chapter 12 which is brief, looks at phantom clowns. These seem to be a few furtive individuals lurking in some form of clown costume and just plain phantoms existing in the minds and perceptions of people. Chapter 13 discusses trolls and the future of bad clowns--internet trolling is an interesting connection to make with clowns.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 2.03}, {"id": "211076", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThey're map pins and they prick easily and hold things onto surfaces well.

Additionally, I saved the music video to this song in my youtube history last week after also viewing and hearing their B.Y.O. B song.

It turns out that he was listening to Toxicity on his itunes account a couple of days before when I was away working my overnight shift. We both listen to various types of music, with rock being one of them. The only difference is that I usually listen to rock music blended with other music genres (such as with electronica, indie rock, a type of rock rap etc) while my husband sometimes prefers harder versions of rock (such as Ramstein). I know that this may sound strange and even crazy to others, but this made sense to me (my husband listening to Toxicity while I was at work and me picking up this song in my head two days later) because I feel that both my husband and I have a strong and powerful connection due to being kindred spirits and getting to know each other the longer we have been married (Im happy and thankful to report that we have been married for 10. 5 years now). I do not fully understand the lyrics, but I admit to enjoying this song due to the compelling singing and the way that the music instruments complement the timing of the song.  As for my husband, he enjoys Toxicity by System Of A Down because he sees it as a hard rock motivational type of track.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

At this price, all the features should work flawlessly and seamlessly.  They just don't.  To begin with, the internet connection is, at best, intermittent and it seems to require password input every few minutes.  The Sound Station is connected (at least some of the time) to our security-enabled wireless network.  It's in the same room as my TiVo and my computer, neither of which has problems with connectivity but the Sound Station loses the connection regularly.\n\nSeveral of the buttons are unresponsive.  Touch them and absolutely nothing happens.  The alarm button, for example, does nothing when pushed so I haven't been able to test the alarm feature at all.  Some of the other buttons will react at times but not at others.  The \"copy\" function certainly has a mind of its own; sometimes it will save a file to memory, at other times, it just ignores the command.\n\nIn addition, there are several of what I would call design flaws.  For example, there is no ability to save media in folders or to set up playlists.  The Sound Station allows you to sort only alphabetically or chronologically, either ascending or descending, which limits the ability to play an entire album in order or to play a symphony as it was written.  The foregoing is theoretical.  In fact, my machine sorts everything by date no matter which selection I choose.  There's also no way to search or to locate a selection intuitively.  In order to \"scroll\" through the contents on a flash drive you must swipe your finger from the bottom of the page to the top.  When you have many, many pages, this is not only tedious, it can make you crazy and you still don't have the ability to choose the order of your music or pictures.\n\nI've also found the USB port to be finicky.  It will accept one of my 16GB thumb drives but not another of the same make and capacity.  My computer recognizes both but not Aura.\n\nI hope that these problems get ironed out because there is a lot to like about the Aura Sound Station.  Assuming that it was working as intended, it has a lot of convenient features and I think the sound is quite decent for a system of this kind.  The little remote, while limited in function,  is very responsive and the station is sleek and good-looking.\nScore:\n2\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I installed it on a barely two month old Toshiba laptop  (Intel Core 2 Duo 2.80 GHz, 6 GB RAM, Vista Home Premium, 64 bit) which up until then, was running like a dream.  Trend Micro first had me uninstall my previous AV software (AVG Free) and Spybot Search and Destroy which I did.  I closed all open applications and ran the installation disk.  But even at that, things did not go smoothly.  After the installation was complete the first thing I tried was to access the UI but clicking on the icon in the system tray elicited no response; right click, left click, it didn't matter, nothing happened.  While I was considering my options, I noticed that the firewall was turned off.  Since I couldn't get into the interface, and trying to turn it on via the control panel was unsuccessful, I re-booted the computer hoping that would make things right.  Nope.  A second re-boot produced the same results.\n\nI'm pretty stubborn and I really wanted to try out the features in this software but one thing convinced me that perhaps it just wasn't for me.  My system, previously so fast and responsive was behaving as if someone had poured molasses into the processor.  It was sluggish in the extreme and even the simple process of opening a browser window took eons.  It was at that point that I decided to uninstall the program.\n\nI don't know if the problems I had with Trend Micro resulted from Vista, as some have suggested (doubtful since many other Vista users have reported success) or whether they're caused by a conflict with some of the other programs I'm running.  I do know that although Trend Micro has worked very well for others, it just does not agree with my system.\n\nI hesitated over the star rating to give this product since I wasn't able to evaluate it fairly.  I would have preferred to omit the rating entirely but since that isn't an option, I'm giving it two stars which I hope reflects both its incompatibility with my computer and the success that others have reported in using the program.\nScore:"}], "output": "2\n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 1.69}, {"id": "211079", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nLove the print and colors.

He's filming a new movie in her country, so she decides to pay a visit to the set. Luke is growing tired of his life and needs a vacation. The two meet rather unexpectedly; Alex knowing it was Luke, but Luke thinking her to be someone entirely different. Surely not a princess. The two meet, for real, and Luke is surprised Alex is the same woman. She wants him to be interested in her as a woman but she knows that his occupation affords him many options in that department. Luke, well he feels that she is so out of his league, he can't even fathom. So, she decides to keep visiting him on set hoping to encourage him. Can't he take a hint? To his surprise, she has been on his mind constantly the last week. Soon they begin to meet in the shadows and become closer. To be together, Luke would have to give up the life he worked so hard to have. THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME! LOVED THE CHARACTERS! I especially love the way Luke was portrayed; not snobby or entitled. He was a normal guy, well as normal as an actor could be. Sure he was sexy and gorgeous, but he was also down to earth and level headed. Just a guy trying to be his best in the career he chose for himself. Alex, well she's a princess but not just any princess. The Crown Princess, next in line for the throne. She is regal and stately, but not full of herself. She knows what her future holds and accepts without a qualm. They have a great connection which leads to great sex. Is that all they will ever have? This is a story about love. No matter what social status you have, love can conquer all. His Royal Princess is a novella in A Billionaire Boys Club series. This series is AMAZING !

What keeps it down is how it's built and the lack of comfort. Audio-wise, these are awesome to use when listening to music. It takes me back to the mid-90s when I would come home from school and just lay back, put on some music and put on a huge pair of headphones, hearing every little change in tone as the tracks went on. Things like Skype calls and games fare just as well. It's great that this headset stays true to its word when it comes to the battery life. A full charge will last you a good amount of time, and even a half charge should get you through 7 hours or so of continuous use at normal levels.\n\nThe big issue I have with this headset is how uncomfortable it is. I've used several over the ear headsets and headphones over the last year, and none have been this uncomfortable. From how snug the actual pieces that go over your ears are, to how they cause glasses to dig into the sides of your head, I can't stand to wear these things for more than 20 minutes at a time. If you don't wear glasses, or have extremely slim frames, then this shouldn't be an issue. The removable microphone could have been made better too, and bending it to move it out of the way when needed for just a moment can take longer than it should. And you can kiss the foam covering for the mic goodbye too after anything barely taps it. It constantly falls off, causing me to give up on that little thing almost entirely.\n\nThere are a lot of other small problems that I can see becoming big ones as time goes on too. A couple of other reviewers, who have owned this headset for a few months, have mentioned parts falling off and the faux leather pads that go over your ears hardening over time. Things like that make the big price drop that the headset gets every couple of weeks seem justified. It just doesn't seem like a quality product, especially when there are better options out there for around the same price. This thing looks cheap in the box, and feels cheap when you're holding it. And yet it manages to have great sound quality!\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Granted, there aren't many people who I play with online that also have headsets, and I don't play that many games that are team based or require much communication, but it's always nice to be able to do so in something like say, Borderlands 2. When I was offered a chance to get one of these RIG headsets, I figured now was the time to give it a shot. Given that this is the first one I've used, I can't say that it's the best out there, or worth its price. I -can- say that this sucker is comfortable, clear and makes for an enjoyable gaming experience, letting you hear all the game's audio while talking to your friends. As an added bonus, you can even listen to music on your phone or mp3 player with it with the right jack.\n\nIt may seem gimmicky to include a port for your phone, and I can safely assume that most people won't be using this feature. However, it's still nice to have in case you're waiting for an important call, or have a job position where people are calling you frequently. Both the mic that flips out of the headset, and the one that hangs from the cord are great and worked without any problems.\n\nIf I had something to compare this to, I'd give a more detailed review. Since it's my first item like this, it'll serve as the standard if I get another one. I haven't used it a whole lot for games since I don't play many multiplayer ones, given my work schedule, but for anyone who's looking for a quality headset that isn't going to break the bank, this would be an optimal choice.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.47}, {"id": "211083", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis is a well priced food with mostly decent ingredients.

Still all instruments masterfully adapt to these variations; in fact Turilli throws in some of the fastest power metal riffs one has heard in a long time; Alex Staropoli's keyboards are more than ambitious contributing both rhythm and melodic sections.\nLione does a masterful job on the vocals, as always, still one might find it hard to follow the lyrics when sung choir-like at full speed (yet this also stands as a complement for the band's technical ability). Never forgetting Alex Holzwart who wages wars behind his drum set, while it often seems as his playing is actually leading the band through the song.\n\nFavourite songs include the dramatic `Sea of fate', the orchestral/neoclassical `Crystal Moonlight' and the extra melodic `Raging Starfire'.\n\nFurthermore placing Sasha Paeth on the mixing board was a clever move; having worked with multi-track project such as `Avantasia', Paeth in away stands as a guarantee that all instruments and voices will come clearly through the mix, displayed at similar volume.\n\nAny way you look at it, `The frozen tears of angels' is a heavy hitting power metal album; some of the fastest and most aggressive instrumentations are to be found on this release while also retaining the highest standards in terms of musicianship and production.\n\n\"Metal Hammer\" Greek magazine (issue 305) marks this album with 7/10 commenting: \"`Rhapsody of fire' are now focusing on speed and aggression which makes for a more guitar oriented sound.\"\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Rue, guitarist Jorn Viggo Lofstad, bassist Steinar Krokmo, drummer Stian Kristoffersen and keyboardist Ronny Tegner re-emerge under a somewhat new musical approach.\n\nOn \"Heavenly ecstasy\" the group takes a considerable musical turn towards melodic metal, suppressing the progressive element on most songs on the album. You can always expect instrumental twists and turns but for the biggest part the musical structures have been simplified making \"Heavenly ecstasy\" a catchier and perhaps more direct album. Possibly the change in artistic direction could be partly attributed to the change in record label; having left \"LMP\", the group signed with the renowned \"SPV\" which might also explain why it took this long for \"...Ecstasy\" to be released.\n\nIt has to be addressed that the band does retain its heaviness as the production qualities are similar to previous \"Pagan's mind\" albums. Having said that, on some songs the main passages come out so clean that, believe it or not, deliver an AOR-essence; such tunes are \"Intermission\", \"Follow your way\", \"Walk away in silence\" and \"Live your life like a dream\".\n\nIndeed \"Heavenly...\" is probably the catchiest \"Pagan's Mind\" album to date without completely disregarding their progressive nature.

The clock light is not obnoxious either, just a very smooth bluish tint. Let's not forget a light for the filling area as well. This is all offered in a fairly space conscious design.

Very glad I did, as it works as a snap hanger on a pack, cool storage options, or even just a fiddle object (which i employ a lot). The beverage stays at temperature for a surprising long time, and that functionality hasn't faded in almost a year.\nThe lid employs the form factor of an older thermos-style spigot, yet opens by the flip of a thumb. It clicks down to lid for staying open, or a finger will release and reseal it. This helps round out the design making it a functional and sensible product. Tricky to clean though, so i soak it first. I dropped it in the vehicle with good results. It will stay sealed from about a two foot drop to a seat, or  continued three foot total drop to floor. For extra drop detail, a drop and bounce on a trail has done quite well bouncing over down basic rocks. I wouldn't throw it though, but I'd expect the same.\nFinally, when drinking, there is little to no splash through during rough or jarring motion. I do share the occasional drip on my nose, because of the rubber 'cork' in the seal, normally only on full cups and very sleepy!\nI totally recommend this product to anyone that asks about it.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.92}, {"id": "211098", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nNot as good as I remember from my youth but still entertaining for a lone weekend with nothing but rain and an imagination.

Lisa offers to help her get a job on the farm, but little did she know she'd be working beside bad boy Landon, who had a bit of a reputation for hooking up with girls and lived life in the fast lane. It's clear that Sadie is attracted to him, but seeing how her last relationship ended, she isn't looking for anything serious. Landon can be a dick at times, but after peeling back his layers and allowing himself to open up to her, they develop a friendship that quickly turn into more than either of them expected.\n\nI don't want to go into too much detail because I want everyone to enjoy this book as much as I did, but the endOMG...gut-wrenching doesn't even begin to describe what that ending did to me.

I base this review upon ease-of-use, comfort (even for a shorter person), and storage.\n\nThe Wheel Master is extremely easy to set-up and use, straight out of the box. Once the handle is snapped into place, the unit is ready to use. It comes with a wrist-strap and a trigger-like handle that is designed with some good ergonomics. When your hand is holding the trigger handle, the brake is easy to press without losing grip of the handle, as is the reset button. It glides great and stops on a dime, making accurate measurements easy. Collapsing the unit from its 38\" to 19\" for carrying and storage is performed by pressing a button towards the base of the handle. Where the handle folds is a second, built-in handle for carrying the unit once it is collapsed. It is very light-weight (around 4 lbs.), but still feels sturdy.\n\nThe unit comes with a kick-stand. The utility of the stand depends on your usage. For measuring straight distances, the kick-stand may not be necessary, but if you have incremental measurements where you may need to stop and mark something every X feet or so, the kick-stand may be useful for you.\n\nThe box I received also has a convenient carrying case for carrying around the unit or storing in between use. Just collapse the handle and insert the entire unit. It fits in with minimal manipulations. However, when the unit is folded down, as mentioned, it has a carrying handle, so the case is not necessary, but is a nice bonus feature for storage or if the wheel gets dirty (you can toss it in the case and then carry it without worrying about dirt getting on your clothes). The case appears to be machine washable, but I haven't actually tried it yet. It is made out of heavy-duty weaved nylon and has two straps, so that the unit can be worn and carried like a back-pack, if desired.\n\nOverall, the measuring wheel works great. The only drawback is that the units of measure are in feet and inches, with no metric option. If you need a metric measurer, you will either need to convert it or buy a different one.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It has an adjustable seat (moves forward and back) so that as your child grows and their legs get longer, you can simply pop the seat back out and place it in the next set of holes back. It can be adjusted three times, about 1.5 inches back each time.\n\nAssembly: Assembly was extremely straight-forward. In fact, my 13-year old son put it together with no problem. The instructions are easy to follow and it requires minimal tools (see photos). The tools we used were a small, adjustable wrench, a hammer, and a flat head screw driver. There weren't any particular tricky parts, but the hammer was useful to push in some of the pieces (such as the caps at the end of the rear axle). All the stickers are already applied, so no worries about DIY stickers that end up crooked or with air bubbles underneath. My son was able to put the entire tricycle together without me saying a word, so I would say the instructions were very well-written.\n\nOnce assembled, it worked great. Both boys and girls will enjoy this Big Flyer (apparently there is a pink version as well). As for age range, it will definitely depend on the size of your child. It was way too big for a young 2-year old, but by 3, some kids may have long enough legs to ride it (it is rated for 3+, but again, it will really depend on the size of your child, rather than age, in my opinion).\n\nOverall, this tricycle is a lot of fun for kids and is easy on the adults. I highly recommend it!\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.44}, {"id": "211112", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI have owned this book since it first came out years ago and am so happy it became available for my kindle.

Roberta is so knowledgeable about medieval times - she makes it very interesting to view the life from a 'lower class' point of view. Of course, lower class does not mean they are not people of honor and that 'upper class' people are naturally people of honor. There are villains and heros in all people, of course. Roberta always tells a good story - there's humor and love and a real picture of life in those times.

Surely my decision to drift through a test and a paper on other people's discussions (ranging from 'greatest book ever' to 'a tiring, endless bore')was appropriate at the time for my cynical inexperience had not yet adjusted me for the sheer force of humanity of this titanic struggle.\nA story in pictures and abbreviated words, The Grapes of Wrath paints an honest vision of crushing defeat endured through hard times when visualized hopes were the only things required for living.  We are swept in to a duststorm, a cascade of brief apocaylpse that batters our eyes shut only to force them open to see what is going on beneath the howl of the wind.  This is what calamities cause and here is how man will always scramble for survival.\nThe world opens up and becomes filled with people, beginning with the solitary wandering of a just-released inmate ambiling through the dead, dried out land, to search for his family.  People join and surround Tom--later the Joads--and the dazed survivors all travel, bringing customs, and search the wide world for a new place to make a living.  Their dreams and ambitions mix and then expand, groups are formed, families split apart and multiply, the crush of the storm has infected the people and now they go forward and tear up even more of the land in the search for a home.\nThe book ends in the rain, all pain and dryness washed away into the mud, the dreams coming to an end, situations grown more desperate but at least temporarily endurable--the truth about where hope lay shining and glistening before them, lost in the bible or dreams of wealth or hopes for the future or the nucleus of a loving family surrounding them.  Something is planted in that rain, finally, the milk of human kindness mixing with the mud to burst forth flowers and dew and yet another new chance to make something out of survival.\nIt really is a wonderful story told with great wisdom, dignity and style.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

As a fan of a few of his other works (notably The Great Gatsby, This Side of Paradise and The Collected Short Stories), I went into this book with a healthy enthusiasm. . . What I discovered was a story that was painful to watch unfold and one that kept me engaged and interested in what was happening from the first page to the end.\n\nIt tells the tale of Dick Diver, his wife Nicole, and numerous other equally complicated individuals who sway in and out of their lives over the years following World War One and just prior to the rise of Adolph Hitler.  Americans living in or around Paris and the resort spots of France, these are rich people, people so rich that their money has literally destroyed them.  They have become those rare people who don't have to wish for anything physical, whether it comes in the dream of a mansion on a hill in some far away country, a group of friends that includes royalty and movie stars, or sexual conquests with anyone you can even momentarily desire.  All their dreams have, or could possibly on a whim, come true.  And so there is nothing in this life left for them . . .\n\nIt is a sad tale of likable people coming unglued, of seeing their lives destroyed and watching nobody care, regardless of their goodness.  It is a story of absolute and utter desolation, finally, as the almost journalistic ending comes at you.  It is like falling out of touch with someone who was once the most important person in your life, hearing vague stories about what they are up to and realizing they are getting fainter and fainter and fainter . . .\n\nThis was quite obviously a very personal book for its author, a disillusioned man who saw many of his own dreams come true early on and who was left to watch his own joy turn into boredom and finally complete indifference.  This book is the nightmare that all of us hope never comes true.  It is somewhat comforting, in the end, to realize that in spite of his own early death, his crazy wife and his alcoholism, F.

I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was definitely not a romance that left me frustrated, mad and even having to skip a few pages because I did not want to read the graphic detail. For the first half of the book I was mad, I did not like how the main character represented women so poorly, how obedient and weak she was portrayed. How it seemed that she could take care of herself, until a man showed up and then she was useless. It is like pseudo feminism. Feyre is taken into the Faerie world because she accidently took the life of a Faerie and she does not quite realize the full repercussions of her actions. These actions start a train of events that not everyone is ready for. Towards the end, as the main character Feyre came to her senses (about her potential) the book got really interesting and good for me. It almost made up for the bad beginning.  After  I finished it, even found myself missing the characters and the world. This just goes to show not to judge a book too soon, as well as showing how much of an investment reading really is. This book is definitely up for debate on whether it has a positive or negative depiction of females so I am not sure if I would recommend it.

Different! And better. This stuff gives the results of a good carnauba paste wax, but apparently in a different way. ICE squirts out of the bottle like sewing machine oil or gun oil - very low viscosity. It is clear, thin and oily-feeling. As you apply it with the applicator, there is very little resistance or friction, unlike paste wax. So application thus is very easy and very fast. I applied ICE to a clean, shiny, red 2005 T-Bird in the shade on a hot day. After 10 min., the car still looked oily, but I followed directions and began to buff it with a microfiber cloth. I advise you not to use other polishing cloths. I am told that using old t-shirts, dish towels and the like will give a disappointing result with lots of streaks and dry looking areas. Those materials, unlike microfiber, absorb too much of the still slightly soft ICE surface, whereas the microfiber cloth spreads it evenly.\n\nThe results were excellent. After buffing, the finish feels waxy, but not at all oily. Rubbing your finger on the paint gives about the same result as if a paste wax had been applied. Yes, of course you can create a fingerprint or smear, but no worse than after paste waxing. ICE, like paste wax is, after all, a shiny surface coating, not paint. I like using ICE. It is as good as paste wax, but much easier to apply and buff. I estimate that the effort is less than 25% of using paste wax. ICE also does not leave white residue on black plastic, rubber, or in difficult-to-polish areas like sheet metal seams or the edges of chrome trim or insignia.\n\nA word on durability. I have read that the worst destroyer of car wax is not sun or water, but both when they occur at the same time for a significant period. So if your car has a heavy coat of dew in the morning, or is wet with rain, and then the sun shines on the car for a while, that will quickly break down the wax. Do your own research, but if you find me correct, then that means you must shield your car from the effects of sun and water together. If you have a garage or carport, you need to empty the junk out and use it to shelter your car. If no garage or carport, then you need to buy a cover for your car so it doesn't suffer the sun shining on it when its surface is wet. You don't want to take time, effort and money for any waxing if it cannot last long.\n\nDo I recommend the stuff? Absolutely. After using ICE, I doubt that I will ever go back to paste car wax. I am proud of my car and fussy about keeping it attractive and as perfect as I can. I believe that ICE allows me to do that.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

TBH, it's been a LONG time since I read the first one (Someday) and I still think about Danny and Mace. If you are new to this series or didn't know it WAS a series, you'll enjoy the books more if you read them in order.  You're going to want to read them all anyway so just do them in order. :)\n\nJared and Tristan may not seem to have much in common.  They admit that.  But they both don't quite 'fit' in the life they are living.  Jared is vaguely dissatisfied with his life and career path.  Tristan doesn't really feel like he belongs in places where he should feel a sense of belonging.  Once they become part of each other's lives, they fit each other and any other discomfort they had doesn't have much impact anymore.\n\nJared was in control without being overly dominant or pushy.  Tristan liked to be controlled but he wasn't a wuss.  (He did seem a little immature but that felt real.  He is only 21 and a touch naive.  And his immaturity wasn't really problematic, it was more like part of his character.)  There were interesting plot developments like Tristian's family situation and Jared's art show (uh....some of the descriptions of the art were HOT!). At one point, Jared tells Tristan, \"I love the mess that you are.\"  And the author has us gobbling this up like it's NOT an insult, like it IS loving and tender to say.  That's skilled writing, people.\n\nI'm sad the series is over but the author references a collaborative group in the 'after notes' and now I want to see if I detect the 'Sierra Riley' style in other books.  And the after notes....uh, that was mind blowing.  For one thing, it was all so....meta.  The characters talking about the characters and the author.  And breaking the fourth wall.  Funny.  Clever.  And that stereotypical 'needle screeching across a record' sound you heard?  That was my mental brakes that came on as I encountered VERY familiar names in those notes.  What a kick.  Easy to rate this one 5 PROMISING stars.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Absolutely loveable MCs, with engaging plots and always sexual tension.\n\nThis book is no different; the MCs are adorable, though we already knew that about Cash, having seen him in Delicious and Falling, though briefly.  What is very different (besides being set in the Seattle area) is the serious tone of this book.  The others are much more light-hearted and fun.  While this one has SOME fun, the main conflicts in the plot are quite sobering.  Robbie was hurt badly in a car accident.  Robbie's 'best friend' Sarah nearly lost the ability to ever walk again and she did lose her dreams of becoming a professional dancer.  Cash has been bereft without Robbie, and it's gone on for 7 years!\n\nOnce again, I am giving major kudos to Sierra Riley for creating drama and angst but having it develop organically, from the events of the plot.  It would have been easy for her to separate Cash and Robbie and up the drama factor by having either character hide the truth from the other.  I really do not like that kind of angst in a book. (I mean, that kind of angst is their own fault!  It does nothing for me except want to tell the characters they are TSTL.)  We have Robbie being honest about why he does what he does, and then we have Cash being honest about the things that he does.  (Even though those things could have angered Robbie.)\n\nI am seriously looking forward to Beck and Liam's story.

It was swoony, hilarious, and all around wonderful.\nSo first off, I didn't realize this was a retelling of Much Ado About Nothing which only made it twenty times more wonderful because I'm a sucker for a good Shakespeare retelling. Mix in nerd culture, banter, friend groups, and driven teens, and you've got a recipe for success. I was hooked from the second chapter.\nTrixie and her best friends Harper and Meg were awesome. They were smart, confident, and closely bonded. They had disagreements, but there was nothing catty about the trio. Once Ben, Peter, Cornell, and Jack hit the scene, the banter really began. I loved how much the girls teased Ben about his mustache (not a good look for most males, just saying), and I was so glad that the boys didn't exclude the girls from nerd culture or make them feel like fake nerds.\nI wanted Trixie to be my BFF. Her wit was so effortless, she was actually kind when she wanted to be, she loved Veronica Mars, and her character development was A+. She works on her judgmental side, and her judginess never rubbed me the wrong way.\nAnd then the romance. Y'all, I shipped it so hard. I love authentic bantery ships and Ben and Trixie were, like, the king and queen of bantery ships. There's a scene about 70% into my e-galley where I inhaled sharply and was trying not to swoon.

I admired her determination and hardworking attitude. I wasn't surprised when she made it into the Sharpshooters. I was surprised by a couple of things: 1) the lack of supervision for the Sharpshooters (even music groups at my university have more supervision than the Sharps), and 2) how much I enjoyed a story filled with boys. I'm usually all about the female-driven books, but I didn't mind that Jordan was pretty much the only girl on most of the pages. And I really enjoyed the group of friends that developed for Jordan, but I especially loved the romance with Isaac. I liked all of the dynamics with him, and he was super swoony. I enjoyed being able to contrast him with Jordan's ex, and he was so much better for her, partly because Isaac and Jordan got to form a friendship first.\nThe ending felt a little off to me; I think it was mainly the parts post-competition.

The rear wall of the pack is padded down the entirety of it's length plus there is a reinforcement panel and padding for the pack's bottom.\n\nThe sides of the bag each have roomy 7\" x 7\" storage compartments with fold over lids that secure down by leather strapped button closure and also have brass buckles that allow the user to cinch them down more tightly when needed. The side compartments are large enough that I fit two 16.9 Oz water bottles in one of them and the lid still closed over them, so you could easily use them to store a camera or other items you want fast  access to and protect everything from the elements by closing the lid.  Although canvas isn't waterproof, it is water resistant enough to protect your gear during a sudden downpour.\n\nThe back of the bag has a carry/hanging loop affixed to the upper portion, with a wide strip of heavy duty nylon webbing sewn in at the juncture of the handle and carry straps for extra reinforcement.  The entire back of the bag is heavily padded, and the two curved adjustable carry straps are thickly padded for the users comfort, have sturdy brass adjustment buckles and heavy duty web straps that are well reinforced at all stress points.\n\nIt's tough to beat canvas for durability and this bag is no exception. There are no zippers in this pack that could break or cause problems, all of the stitching is tight, neatly done, and well reinforced at stress points, and the genuine leather and solid brass hardware add to the bag's durability.  This large backpack is stylish, functional, rugged, and durable. It's built to handle weight and still provide for the wearer's comfort and should hold up a long time even if used in the elements. It would work well as a school pack, and could also work as well for hiking, fishing, or traveling.

Rather than being made of hard plastic which often tends to crack under weight or if dropped, the exterior of the case is constructed of a well reinforced neoprene like material that can withstand pressure and falls without caving or breaking, so it offers excellent protection for the glass essential oil bottles inside it.\n\nThe inside of the carrier has strong elastic holders that hold each bottles securely and also prevents them from impacting the bottles on either side. Five bottles fit on each side, and there's a modestly padded nylon covered divider in the center that protects the bottles from up and down contact in the event that the case is dropped. Finally, the case has a zippered closure and the zipper functions smoothly.\n\nThe case measures approximately 7\" long by 3.5\" wide and weighs a mere 0.5oz when empty, so it doesn't take up much space or weight in your luggage. If planning to use bottles larger than 10ml be sure to measure them to make sure they aren't over 3.3\" high to be sure they'll fit into the case when zipped closed. I pushed down on this case with as much force as I could to see if the top would cave under pressure and it didn't, so I think it makes an excellent way to transport essential oils (or small bottles of medicines for that matter).\n\nThis essential oil case was provided at no cost by the manufacturer for evaluation and review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.92}, {"id": "211139", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nA masterfully woven collection of stories by the great minimalist Raymond Carver.

It is complex and gritty. There is bloodshed, drug addiction, prostitution, murder, cheating, abuse, loss, lies, and love in many forms. This is not a sweet old western romance. I understand why the author labored over this series. The hero, William, is not the typical hero, he is rescued and does a little rescuing. The heroine, Charlotte/ Laura, is not your typical heroine. She is determined, faithful, caring, has a conscience, and does not one for backing down. She does not apologize for being a doctor and it is so much a part of her that it creates major problems. They both suffer in unimaginable ways. Some of the sufferings are physical, mental and emotional. There are no easy cures or simple fixes. Love is not the perfect answer. Both have to survive in order to live and love each other. I would not recommend this book to anyone under 18 or anyone that is particularly old-fashioned. This series will stay with you long after you have read the last page. You will reread it again and see more the second time you read it than you did the first time. I do not know how Ms. Lenhardt will continue after having written this but, I would like to find out.

I loved it. Absolutely loved it. For a number of reasons.\n\nIt's a horse story. There're not many of them out there, and there's just something about a story with horses that I love.\n\nThe hero, Grady, frequently acts like an unreasonable male prima donna. When I think he's finally got it together, he hauls off and acts ridiculous again. He's a gorgeous, spoiled, self-centered, rich movie star. And while at times he's nice, he can also get caught up in his own 'self' to the exclusion of all else. The heroine, Amanda, starts out overwhelmed by his looks and that status doesn't change for a long time. He's easy to resist because it's all superficial. Later on, as they--finally--peel away their layers, he becomes so much harder for her to resist. This entire situation is DIFFERENT. Sometimes authors' alpha heroes act selfish and self-centered, but Grady is not an alpha. This guy is different. My love for him grew as slowly as Amanda's did.\n\nI loved Grady's daughters. They added so much to the story, and they were delightful. Loved all the secondary characters, including the horses!\n\nA last thing that made this book different--an entire summer goes by and Grady and Amanda have still not had sex. Haven't even gotten close. Have only shared a couple kisses. There's lots and lots of sexual tension in the book, and I actually liked having them hold off--for reasons that changed as the characters' emotions changed--until late in the story. It made the story more real. It made the lovemaking a big step.\n\nI can't wait to read the author's next book, which will feature one of THROWN's secondary characters.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The book is from 1988, and is a bit wordy, as is typical of romance from the '80s. Also typical of the '80s, the sex scenes are ripe with innuendo. The story is amazing, though.\n\nThe hero, a Native American, is a recovering alcoholic. The heroine admires him greatly, and the guy is just a great guy. He's incredibly humble. This story makes clear that battling alcoholism is \"one day at a time.\" The hero struggles. He's unsure of himself and his future. And, after experiencing probably the worst day of his life and after four years of sobriety, he drinks.\n\nI loved this hero. This guy is HUMBLE.\n\nAnd I loved the slow building of the couple's relationship. She's an engineer. She's building a road. He works for her and is her best worker. It takes them a long time to trust each other. To get to know each other. To take a chance with each other. Just lots to like here, and it overcomes the '80s effects.\nScore:"}], "output": "5", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.24}, {"id": "211144", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nBook two in the Bluff Point Romance series/trilogy not sure which.

The mother is Jessie the receptionist at the vet clinic that we met in both of the previous books. She thinks Zach is a player, and Zach has no interest in a relationship so they have pretty much avoided one another before this. Once the cat get involved things get interesting especially as its antics are assisted by a dog that Zach is supposed to be fostering. I swear the two critters had meetings at night to plan all this stuff though it worked out great in the story.

The seating area is approximately 19\" off the ground and the arms are a bit under 25.5\" above the ground. There is a small side compartment that hangs on the right side that has a mesh pocket for small items and a can holder that has a drawstring to hold smaller water bottles. The arms are solid and not fabric so they will not sag when you put weight on them. The tubes that support the chair (legs of the chair) are thick and rigid. The only problem I see is that it is difficult to open and close since the chair is built so rigid. This is actually a good thing and most likely will get easier with use and movement. I had troubles closing and opening it due to the stiffness and it was a bit hard to get the chair fabric folded just right, but I actually see this as a positive. The fabric is a thicker material than those cheap chairs you find everywhere and the stitching and seams are good quality. The weight is a bit much and of course the size is large even when this is stuffed into the carrying case. It will not be great if you must carry this for long periods so keep this in mind.

As others have mentioned, I am frankly shocked that this group is forgotten today.  My ex-wife and I were fortunate enough to go with our best friend to see them at a small club in Dallas back in 1975, after the initial excitement over their Columbia days had ended, and before they started hitting it big with their Capitol albums.  In fact, they played \"Only Sixteen\" that night [which would later be their biggest hit on Capitol] for us that night.  They were an excellent band for a club, and had us partying hard that night!  I had their second album, Sloppy Seconds, when it first came out in 1972, and loved it.  The lyrics, all by the great songwriter Shel Silverstein, are brilliant.  My personal favorites off of Sloppy Seconds are \"Freakin' At The Freakers' Ball\", \"Carry Me, Carrie\", and \"Cover of The Rolling Stone\".  The entire album is wonderfully funny, full of the three pillars of rock: sex, drugs and rock 'n roll!  But at the same times, there are heart-breaking gems like \"Carry Me, Carrie\" that will bring tears to your eyes.\n\nI also liked their AM hit off of their first album, Dr. Hook's Medicine Show, \"Sylvia's Mother\", which I have always recognized as more than a novelty hit.  Listen to it, people!  They do a great version of the song, expressing the anguish of a man trying to get through to his girlfriend, while running out of money at the pay phone [this was long before there were cellphones] and being put off by her mother.  The rest of the first album, unfortunately, isn't as great.  Marie Lavaux is a great song, but much better by Bobby Bare, who had a country hit with it.  The third album, Belly Up! was briefly a staple of FM radio in those heady days of 1972-73, when the radio stations could play what they wanted.  Here in Dallas, that meant KAFM.  Unfortunately, it faded from the scene as KZEW came on and played a strict \"AOR\", or album oriented rock list, tightly controlled by the programmers.  No more Dr. Hook on the radio, at least until their Capitol days, when they did less sexy, less drug songs.  Yes, less fun songs. It is fun to hear these funny drug/sex songs again.  And, this album is well worth the money.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

There wasn't a solution from Toshiba at the time, so I went with this option.  Pluggable was GREAT for the first 3 months of usage.  Then weird things happened with the display...as in no display.  When I bypassed the Pluggable and plugged direct to the laptop's HDMI port, I had good picture, no display problems.  Tech suppport sent me directions to troubleshoot.

When the steps provided failed, they sent me a refurbished Pluggable with warranty ending the day I purchased the first Pluggable.  I thought that was rather lousy of that company...made me worry that they couldn't stand behind their product by restting the 1 yr warranty for the replacement device.  Like the first one, the refurb worked great!  Then soon after the original 1 yr warranty period expired, the refurb display component expired, too.  Everything else works on the Pluggable except the display...and the display is a brand new LED monitor...single wide monitor...I don't even have a dual setup any more.  I had to plug direct to my laptop HDMI port since the Pluggable's HDMI port failed yet again.  Now how in the world did I end up with 2 lemons in the same year???  I did complain to tech support as soon as the refurb arrived that it was sloppily packaged and dirty.  But it did work. But it only worked for the second half of the warranty year.

Radical solutions to unsolvable problems were their only escape.  In the 1790s, when farming was the only occupation, a growing population and a soil spent by generations of misuse, resulted in a dearth of farmable land.  With no prospects and no future, individuals like Eli Whitney and Thomas Blanchard, were forced to look for creative solutions to society's problems and set in motion an industrial revolution.\nI was particularly intrigued by the story of Frederick Tudor, the man who in 1806 introduced ice to Martinique.  It is one thing to sell ice to people who because of their location, understand the concept.  It is quite another, to sell ice to people who have never experienced it, to say nothing about the practical necessities of ice houses to warehouse the product.\nHis father's real estate speculation losses left Tudor with nothing but ambition and a house with a pond in Saugus, MA.  He succeeded after two difficult decades.  There was always a wrinkle to be solved before a fortune could be built.  Iceboxes had to be designed and then marketed in southern ports to people who had to be taught how to preserve it.\nThis phenomenon explains why there so many Crystal and Silver Lakes dot the New England landscape, relics of an enterprising age.  Savvy ice dealers understood that attractive names sell products.  For a brief period even Muir's Bullough's Pond was briefly renamed Silver Lake.\nDiana Muir e-mailed me twice during the past two years introducing her book to me.  Having read her book, I am grateful for her persistence.  If you enjoy reading unique looks at our history, I implore not to wait for her to contact you.

I've played it 3 times on the PS4 and once on the PS3.  I have it on my PC, but lack the hardware to run it smoothly.  Most people hated the protagonist, but I didn't mind him.  I loved the missions and the hacking, but hated the driving.\n\nSo, how does Watch Dogs 2 fare?  Pretty good!  San Francisco looks great.  It's a beautiful world and you'll recognize a lot of real world places.  It feels like a real world place, although far less populated than than in real life.  The protagonist this go around, Marcus, is much happier person than Aiden Pierce.  He laughs!  So that's new.\n\nAfter about ten hours into it, I feel like I have a pretty decent handle on what's going on.  This game, it feels, is a lot more reliant on hacking, though the mission structure hasn't dramatically changed.  There's plenty of stuff to hack, too.  You'll come across plenty of opportunities to you use your phone, jumper or quadcopter to pick up research points (skill points), money drops, etc.  The driving is vastly improved, but it's still not great.  I noticed a bit of input lag.  There are no fixer contracts this time around, but you can be an Uber type driver and take people on various missions.  There are sailboat and off-road races, too.  It's a pretty robust world.\n\nYou trigger the missions from your cellphone.  There are main missions and side missions.  You can sort of pick which order you want to do them.  Talking with various people in the world will trigger various activities.  There's certainly a lot to do and collect and you'll probably spend 15-20 hours driving around taking photos and finding collectibles.\n\nThe AI is much more unreliable in this game.  Sometimes they see you, sometimes they don't.  You can get spotted by an AI and fail the misssion, restart it, do the exact same thing and the AI won't spot you.  The AI, somehow, can manage to spot a body on a rooftop even though there's no line of sight.  The stun guns sometimes permanently knocks people out, sometimes it puts them to sleep for a set period of time before they wake up.  I don't really know why that is, but its frustrating.  I restarted a hideout at least 20 times because the AI was all over the map.  I couldn't progress because the rules kept changing.  It was very frustrating.  I've gotten stuck in the world twice, too.  Once resulted in my death, the other in a hard restart.\n\nSo, all in all, it's a very fun game.  Likeable characters, plenty of ways to perform missions, lots of neat gadgets (you 3D print your gears and guns), a more diverse wardrobe (even though its strictly cosmetic, but its there) a beautiful city and plenty to do.  You can't ask for much more in a game than that.\n\nI hope this helps!\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Given the enormous expectations gamers have expressed, it's easy to see why so man people have felt let down.  Expectation is the precursor to disappointment, sadly.  In that light, take these one and two star reviews with a grain of salt.  No, it's not perfect, but no game is.\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion about graphics.  To my eyes it's a gorgeous game, especially on the ps4.  It doesn't top InFamous Second Son, but it's still a beautiful rendition of Chicago.  A lot of the game mechanics appear to be borrowed from Ubisoft's stable of games:  hacking from Deus Ex, the cover system from Splinter Cell, etc., but they've all been integrated rather nicely.  I found the controls largely fluid, at least while on foot and during gun play. The voice acting was solid, the soundtrack acceptable, and there's simply a ton of stuff to do. 10 hours in and I haven't even completed a Act 1.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of mis-steps in my estimation.  Yes, the driving is atrocious.  Prepare to fishtail...everywhere.  The lack of customization is surprising, whether it be clothing, cars, or anything else.  I noticed little things, like the time not showing on your smart phone/profiler, which struck me as odd.  I had some major frame rate drops during the intro mission, too.  The missions can be very challenging, so prepare to die and fail a lot.\n\nThere's a great sense of paranoia running through Watch_Dogs, especially when other players can hack your game.  We live in a world where virtually no one appears to have any right to privacy:  the NSA, spying, hacking, data centers (I drive past the Bluffdale, UT data center everyday), wi-fi everywhere. There's no way to protect yourself.  Someone's always just a click away from digitally intruding on our lives.  In that regard, Watch_Dogs has plenty to say about modern society and the big, wide gray areas we all inhabit.\n\nI've enjoyed this game a lot.  Give it a try.

It's really a story about a lot of people with lots of random others thrown in somewhat willy-nilly. The focus is on them and their lives, and how they got where they were, and where they are going -- but there's really nothing of \"science\" in it at all.\n\nVirginia DeMarce is not a bad writer, her characters are engaging, but, unfortunately, they aren't distinctive enough, and far too numerous... There are dozens of people mentioned at the drop of a hat, and I constantly find myself stopping and going \"What the F***? Who the hell is that?\" and/or just (after a while), blowing past the mention and not caring. If a story is well written AT ALL I will usually finish it. But it's hard slogging through a book about people who ARE interesting, but seem to spend all their time interacting with a dozen or more others who have no distinctness at all. An example: Tangled Web is, essentially, four \"novellas\" or short stories interweaved. One of those stories is about a courier who happens to have three different wives in different towns he regularly passes through on his route. But the three wives (and a fourth one he \"adds\" in the course of the story) are all so indistinct and unmemorable, pretty much becoming nothing but the town they reside in, and you really DON'T CARE which is which... but you are supposed to, since things that happen cause them to be mentioned.\n\nThis is not the first such \"experience\" I've had with Ms. DeMarce's writing, she's the principle writer, also, on The Dreeson Incident, which is a nominal predecessor to this book. I found the same issues with that, too, it was far more about the internal structure of a family and its interactions, and had almost nothing to do with the actual setting or events surrounding it. They represented something like 5% of the story.\n\nI've put the book down, and I'll probably finish it. But I doubt if I'll remember much of it at all, afterwards. Ms. DeMarce seems to be like David Weber, someone I can read when someone else is riding herd on them, but, when solo, manages to be utterly uninteresting. Others may well disagree, but, in the case of Ms. DeMarce, I have to suggest, \"perhaps SCIENCE Fiction is not the genre you're looking for...?\"\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I did not know bras could actually be comfortable! I should mention, however, that like most women in the U.S., I was shoving my 40J/40GG (US/UK) into 40DD or 42DD, depending on the style-- this is what I have done for over a decade, because I had been improperly measured all the other times. I studied the herroom tips and videos and whatnot before purchasing this \"Caitlyn\" underwire support in a 40GG.\n\nPerfect fit. My breasts are lifted and don't feel so heavy! The tissue that has migrated to under my arms can now be placed in the excellent support. The gore (center) sets perfectly flush against my chest, the way a bra should (I never knew this, until reading up on how to properly fit bras). The straps are strong, with some elasticity (from my readings, straps should not hold more than 10% of the breast weight! The BAND is what provides the support). The higher rise in the center is good for me, because I have a very short torso and a \"steroid belly\" (from corticosteroid treatment). This is a comfort I never knew existed!\nI don't have wires poking into my armpits anymore, and I don't have to *constantly* adjust. I do some adjustments if I've been sitting a while and then get up go to do things, but that's just the nature of the body.\nThe band is a perfect size for me, providing amazing support! The weight of my breasts almost disappears! There are 4 hooks, & the normal \"3 hooks\" adjustment for body fluctuations & as the band loosens over time.\nThis is my bra of choice for DAILY wear, and for my \"boob shirts,\" though I do still need to find a good fitting plunge bra for my true \"boob/cleavage shirts.\"\n\nDefinitely take care when laundering! I learned the hard way (I never had to worry about it before) to wash these bras separate and on the \"handwash\" setting of my front loader; I've always \"hang to dry\" my bras. But one of my Caitlyn's got torn up, because it was in a mesh bag with \"mixed\" darks (jeans, yoga pants, t-shirts, socks, etc). I am extremely mad at myself, because that is one less pricey bra I have to support me!\n\nI will be copying/pasting this review for each of the Caitlyn bras I bought-- all the same size, but different colors.

You can get detailed specifications on Panasonic's Web site or elsewhere on the Internet.\n\nWhat I liked so far:\n1) FM/AM presetting can be automatic. However, living in a big city, it found so many radio stations that it ran out of all presets before even it got to my favorite stations. Manual setting is pretty easy.\n2) VCR rewinding is high-speed. I used to use a rewinder, but this one rewinds much too quickly.\n3) DVD quality and sound quality exceed my expectations - but that doesn't mean anything to you. I never liked my music/movies too loud anyway. System automatically sets subwoofer level at 4 (high) for DVD and at 2 for music CDs - which can be easily changed. We watched Incredibles at level 4, but volume at a decent level. Sounds from ending scenes were way too much realistic for us (and for our children).\n4) Remote is very functional and feels good. Some features need reading the manual.\n5) FM reception is very good.\n\nThings that I don't like:\n1) Doesn't play MP3 songs written to a DVD disc. My older (cheap) system used to do that. Big disappointment for me.\n2) Manual says that I could randomize between different audio CDs. I couldn't get it do that among MP3 disks. It might work on regular audio CDs, but I haven't tried that yet.\n3) Only one set of input jacks. I have HD receiver and a cable receiver. I have connected HD receiver right now and cable goes directly to TV. I am somewhat disappointed with that. Fortunately VCR is built-in. When you want external signal, sytem should be put in VCR mode with AV selected (described in the manual).\n4) Connecting wires to sub-woofer and speakers is difficult. Holes are very small and inserting a multi-strand wire in that hole was a big challenge for me. Wires that come with the system may work fine, but we have pre-wired surround sound in the room which has multi-strand wires.\n\nOther:\n1) Manual clearly says not to push the disk trays in (use the close button)\n2) Disk trays look and feel like delicate\n3) Cable that comes with the system can be used as component cables\n4) Manual could have been better\n5) Best Buy carries them - if you want to look at it\n\n**Updated on 7/3/2005 **\n1) It does randomize between different CDs.

But, this DVD player played it fine.\n4) Overall, still happy with the system.\n\n**Updated on 9/13/2005 **\nI recently encountered the same problem Donald (another reviewer) had experienced. DVD dialogue volume becomes very low or diminishes. However, MP3 music and CDs play fine. So, I called Panasonic. The lady _quickly_ told me to refer to page 41 of the manual and set the 'Center Focus.' I tried that with skepticism, but it worked. Now, the system is back to normal. My overall satisfaction is still high because I found some cool features as I am also finding problems like this. One such cool feature is the ability to search for a song in an MP3 CD of hundreds of songs.\n\n** Update: 9/29/2008\nDisplay at the front died (like it did to many other users), but I am continuing to use it. Yes, it is hard to use it without the display on the unit, but on-screen-display (OSD) on the TV helps to some extent. Replacing the unit is such a time consuming process that I am willing to put up with the inconvenience of no display.\n\n** Update: 6/24/2010\nThe DVD player quit working. It takes too long to read the disk and then displays the error message \"Check the Disk\". I have tried DVDs, MP3 CDs, music CDs, etc. and the problem persists.

I also couldn't understand how natural predators ganged up with their prey on the humans almost like an alliance between the predators and the more benign animals. It was really laughable when Joe gets bitten by a ferret and rather than \"brain\" it or pull it off, the author decides that Joe should take some tongs he has, heat them over a bunsen burner (all the while, this ferret has its teeth buried in Joe's leg) and then take the hot tongs and crush the ferret's head.

I kept flipping back to the copyright page to see if it's a work of fiction, but it was not so. This book is a story of an incredible journey of the author, Kosta Danaos, who begun his quest to find and met with an internal arts master by the name of John Chang and his experiences and lessons with him. From reading this book, I thought it was too unreal to be a fact considering that Chang was able to break the laws of the physical reality. But again, it was not so because I have later seen the videos of Chang's psi abilities in action (e.g., pyrokinesis, telekinesis, and levitation), including the video of Lorne and Lawrence Blair's documentary series \"Ring of Fire.\"\n\nThe one thing that I have found quite interesting from this book is the moral discussion of karma as relating to becoming like Chang. Obtaining the powers, higher than normal, requires a great responsibility. I do agree with Chang that he does not want to create \"monsters\" as to why he was strict on the student selections. That made sense since nowadays a thirst for psychic powers is, in an essence, an ego boost or superiority. Also, discussions of Yang and Yin and Mo-Pai tradition are informative read.\n\nThinking back on it now, the stories surrounds Chang reminds me a lot like Castaneda's Don Juan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Teachings-of-Don-Juan-a-Yaqui-Way-of-Knowledge/dp/0671822896/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Teachings of Don Juan: a Yaqui Way of Knowledge</a>.\n\nConsidering the fact that English was not Danaos' first language, this book is really well written and well organized.

Whether or not if it is a real story, this book is an intriguing and fascinating read, especially the stories about the \"Immortals\" of the ancient past, but that's just me.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

When I saw it on a movie channel recently I thought they cut off the end so they could run HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER on time. Only later did I find that what I'd seen was, in fact, the end...as if the production had simply run out of film and money. Then I learned it was a Cohen Brothers film and I've yet to see a satisfying film by them. They have talent, just no perceivable attention span. That said, the movie was enormously entertaining while it lasted. I hope some day someone will finish the story. The least the evil cartel hit man could have done is kill the two kids at the end. They did, after all, see him.\n\nThe movie was cast very well, the script was extraordinary, the acting first rate. The direction was mostly excellent EXCEPT that most seasoned cops wouldn't have stood in an empty doorway holding a gun and facing into a darkened hotel room, perfectly backlit, like the sheriff did in the end. And most seasoned sheriffs probably would have had the milk bottle checked for prints before pouring himself some milk from the same bottle. Finally, most seasoned professional assassins wouldn't leave their fingerprints spread so promiscuously around the places our bad guy (\"Sugar\") did while he was looking for the money. Still, what do a couple of young Yankee Jewish kids know about such things? That was a nice shot of Tommy Lee Jones standing silhouetted against the lights outside, his handgun held at the ready. (Had anyone been in that darkened room with a gun...even a .22LR pistol...the last thing Tommy Lee would have seen was the muzzleflashes before the bullets slammed into his body. I'm sure their were a lot of trained law enforcement types who cringed at these parts of the movie.)\n\nI reckon the point of the film is that bad people do bad things and no one can stop them, no matter how many generations come and go. Even Sugar doesn't make it out unscathed. For all his belief in fate, he nearly gets killed in an automobile accident while distracted by two kids on bikes.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Fawning no doubt will be heavy on the sauce, it's nothing personal, just good writing is awl.\n\nHow can such fun in reading be possible? One asks the stars as they lean in to watch the scene unfold. There is a feeling that Brown Dog Redux should have come before The Farmer's Daughter, if only for the fact that B.D. made his entrance in The Summer He Didn't Die (one of the best short stories ever written btw), and I suppose I had high hopes for B.D.'s grand beginning, the other thing is that while B.D. is loved, that is the weaker story (if only for the fact that The Summer He Didn't Die is so strong and impecable) and The Farmer's Daughter is the Grandstand while the later The Games of Night rounds out a stunning winning finish. Note: The Games of Night does contain some squeamish animal scenes, I chose to look away. And there are some other scenes that turned me pink and I felt as if I wanted to slap Mr. Harrison lightly on the hand and say, \"Why you old cur!\" - - Just an old dog feeling his oats in writing and more than getting away with it.\n\nOne gets a fluid sense of always being on the go with this collection. No character stops anywhere for long, almost like a wandering travelogue. There is something about Mr. Harrison's quick pace, that the reader can happily jog along through tumbleweeds in Texas, then all the way up the map to Montana in just the blink of a day; then suddenly over to Spain and back to Texas; I personally love this narrative style, it transports me to places I cannot go. Also, one will not go hungry for lack of culture; famous artists such as Modigliani and Fernando Pessoa quotes jump right into the party; rounding the corner one can feel the hot breath of Salvador Dali as he takes in these wild scenes. All three stories are like a special jolt of habanero sauce to the senses; each one is unique. B.D. who is perpetually on the wrong side of everything, and Gretchen with her big heart to come and help him along. He isn't a bad spirit, rather the opposite, just not too bright in matters of making money, and his favorite pasttime is fishing and spending time in the woods; at times his obsession with the female anatomy gets a bit trying, but this is his character and one can almost laugh at his lightheartedness; this is a certain mask over the great despair of his life and I would rather laugh than grow despondant. He weathers the storm of leaving Berry better than I thought he would. I am hoping for a Berry story somewhere down the road, with her gull cries and Indian Dancing.\n\nThe Farmer's Daughter begins parries and ends with the panache of a rodeo queen besting the toughest cowboys. It just simply is good writing. There is a feeling that when Mr. Harrison casts his net, even the fog lifts; that the heavy sleepers rise from their depths to taste the line; crows gather round asking whether to pray for the body, bury the body, or simply disassemble the body; a hand goes up in the air, in the midst of a girl losing her beloved Tim, a flock of Eagles are staved mid-cry; as if the rattlesnakes know the sound of his footfall in loose gravel and bust a move; as if his words have the power to turn back a sea of homesick armies berthing them home to yellow ribbons thirsty hearts and tired eyes; this writing is so fluid, as of a canonical boat ride through marshes that have yet to wake; other places, funny and sun burnt sections whipping around like a Catahoula jumping from a flatbed truck in hot pursuit of wild game; as if he simply flops down in a sandy playground, just as B.D. is saying goodbye to Berry; a master playing with a child once more; as of a Buddha watching over his beloved. The all inclusive dogma that Harrison weaves so well falls like a veil of contentment over the land with the very last scene. Weep the good weep. Smiles all around. A short yet satisfying glimpse at the Two Hearted River will have Hemingway fans eyes blinking in wild delight ~ Nothing short of grand.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

For some time now I have kept this book near me, for simple saving moments, when I need to find a place of hope to dive into.\nI always feel rich when I read this book, even if I don't have two dollars to my name. I call that divine\npower, the ability to drap ones frame in security and elegance.\n\nThere are many wrestlings with the almighty dollar in Harrison's writing, maybe that's why I identify with it so much. Sometimes it comes so easily that its best just to give it all away and other times it barely comes at all so why save? There are big questions regarding what does it mean to give up safety and a future for a few moments of adulterated love, and why is it that when the cost is so high that always makes the treasure so much more alluring. If you can't afford a vacation, Harrison will take you there; albeit rather smarmily and with the very same regret you may have felt once enjoying a five thousand dollar vacation you look down to see that not only is your wallet gone, but there are a band of ne'er do wells on their way to see you. So lovely.\n\nBy far, The Man who Gave Up His Name is such a comical, legendary, and yes, romantic piece; and on conditional terms shall stave the heart. If one is willing to completely let themselves free fall into the orange and navy hued melting sunset narrative that literally bleeds of aching where the days grow lengthier yet simpler as the future approaches, much like a leisurely sea swell; all are ocean view.\n\nI first saw the movie \"Revenge,\" with Kevin Costner some years ago, and thought, \"well, that was pretty.\" - - obviously, the novella is like having a choice between real or fake. I own this book for one reason: Nordstrom. I have dreamt upon this very life change so many times, I dare say it's under option's 1,2, and 3 for things I would do if given the chance.\n\nSome women may look at these stories as sexist, and I would caution them to take a second look. Nordstrom, if his character is to be understood is a man whose heart lies within a deep ravine and few can get to it. Still, why punish a man for having sexual yearnings? Yes, there are other Jim Harrison novels where I would agree there is a dash of sexism, yet for Legends, I can make no such call. Certain characters have a crude way of looking at women, and who seem preoccupied with the female anatomy, B.D. comes to mind; however, this is inherent in his character and several other characters do not exhibit the same bawdliness. \"The Farmer's Daughter,\" which has just come out, displays an amazing sense of clarity and sensitivity toward the awfulness of Rape and the Post Traumatic Stress that follows. Sarah is a character that Harrison has drawn richely into a Montana framework and that story alone shows a compassion that very few writers attempt much less champion.\n\nMy advice is to plan on having a good time with this book; like a long sought after fishing trip. First, take off your watch, then forget the time, let your boat drift as she may, and just read.\n\nHaving a few moments with an American Master is a luxury many can afford within these troubled times, yet some forget the opportunity for grand transcending.

This new sub has different colors (as do the people), has a different shape to the metal frame that holds the motor, and adds three small items for the submarine to grab. Our kids love this toy. MSRP is 32.99. It is always worth while checking the Playmobil website for the current pricing and model line-up.\n\nThe diving mechanism really works. A small hand pump connects to the top of the submarine with a tube. You decrease buoyancy by pressing a release button on the pump. You increase buoyancy by pumping. Note, kids sometimes get water in the pump and pump line. You merely need to orient the pump outlet downwards (so water drains) and pump it a few times and it will clear. Also, our submarine requires that you have the motor assembly attached in order for it to dive. It is too buoyant without it.\n\nThe top of the submarine opens up and it has seats for the two diver/operators. The side of the sub has attachment points for grabber arms, faux thrusters, and faux lights. These parts do come off every now and then, so make sure kids gather them before you open the tub drain.\n\nThis may seem like an expensive tub toy, but one of the things we've learned about Playmobil is that the plastic does not mold like cheap bath toys. I don't why this is so. With cheap bath toys, mold can show up in the cracks fairly quickly. We have never had to do anything but rinse the Playmobil toys. Your mileage may vary, but all of our Playmobil bath toys are nearly as good as when they were purchased.\n\nA number of the other Playmobil boats make good bath toys as well (e.g. Fisherman with Boat and Playmobil Fire Boat with Trailer), though like the submarine, they do have small parts that need to be gathered before draining the tub.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

This mask fits a wide variety of faces (in a pinch, I could use it) but I would be hesitant to purchase it for a 6-7 year old unless they have a larger or rounder head than most kids. I think the sweet spot for this mask is probably 9 to 12 years old, but your mileage WILL vary.\n\nAs for quality, the mask and snorkel work fine. I'm not impressed with the frame of the mask; the arms that connect the buckle to the glass frame are thin (clearly visible in the product photos). The pin for the buckle is of a small diameter (perhaps 3/16\"). Overall, the quality is better than some cheap sets I've seen at sporting goods stores, but not as good as what you would find at a scuba shop (e.g. a Scubamax Dolphin). This is a blister pack product. Still, I think it does the job for snorkeling and if you get a good fit, well that's 90% of the challenge.\n\nAlso, it is customary with dive masks to clean off the inside of the glass with toothpaste in order to remove any film left over from manufacturing.

Nothing that happens in it really should happen, least of all the attraction between the cute-as-a-button titular character and the pug-ugly who intrudes on her well-ordered life. None of the main characters, from Valley Girl Julie (Deborah Foreman) to Hollywood lowlife Randy (Nicholas Cage), has a real clue about anything that's going on, but that doesn't stop them from blundering along into and eventually over obstacles that largely exist only their own culturally prejudiced minds.\n\nOne obstacle, Julie's Valley boyfriend Tommy (ex-boyfriend if you buy early developments), has a serious territoriality problem, but for the most he's almost beside the point. He's merely Randy's mirror image, no more flawed than his rival except in being smug instead of disarming. Far more daunting are Julie's friends, a gaggle of giddy girls who apply the peer pressure like nobody's business, and seem incapable of learning from experience. The one friend who knows too well what Tommy's about makes only the vaguest swipes at warning Julie about him, and ultimately gives up to no purpose.\n\nThere aren't many anchors attached to the proceedings, least of all the few adults in the vicinity. Julie's father still deeply feels the passing of his era (the late 1960s), while her mother could just as well be her big sister. There is, however, a wonderful sense of affection among them, and the parents do have a genuine grasp of what a generation gap is all about. They would be the very last people to have a problem with their daughter going with a guy like Randy, so long as he was what she really wanted.\n\nWhat puts this film over is the sense in the narrative that life really isn't about things that should happen, that the choices it places before us are never fair, and that we're almost never equipped, at any time of life, to deal with them when they arise. The script gives you the impression that it's wrapped things up at the end, but if so it's only in terms of momentary events.

What sets Taylor apart is she proved you don't need to sell sex to sell records; you don't need to be on major label to top the charts; you don't need to be old to write songs that are universal tales about the human condition; you can be a role model without being a hypocrite or a prude; you can be a celebrity without being a train wreck - and most importantly for the sake of this review - you can pack 14 singles onto an album without a single dud.

Initially, I was quite caught up in the story of a family moving to the father's North Carolina home town, purchasing an architecturally unique home on a mountainside that had long been abandoned because a family had died mysteriously in it. While the Asters in some ways seem like an ideal family, there's a sense of something dysfunctional about them. Young Henry adores his father, a lawyer who made it rich on a single case and now spends most of his time writing a novel that never seems to be finished, listening to music, and drinking. His mother is a bit of an enabler; she lives her life around her husband's schedule and fetches more drinks whenever she is asked. Henry's sister Threnody is an odd one; she has few friends and relies on the much older Henry for companionship. It is almost like he is the father figure in her life. We're told at the very beginning of the novel that Henry's father \"leaves,\" but that is never really explained until near the end.\n\nI started to be less enthusiastic about this novel about halfway through, when Henry leaves for college and starts acting like a moony geek over a girl with the ridiculous name of Story. Story is beautiful. Story is smart. Story is perfect. Story is unattainable. Story is also rather disturbed by some family dysfunction of her own. I hated her. I should be honest and say that I'm not a huge fan of the typical coming-of-age story, and that is what this section feels like.

But it is often a bit overwrought for my taste. Here's an example that had me scratching my head; it describes a Mexican restaurant:\n\n\"Alternating red and yellow circus umbrellas provided redundant cover from the sun, and sun-bleached spiral streamers ran along the corner trellises and fell down here and there and then ascended again in improbable Lissajous curves that compressed and decompressed with the atmospheric perturbations of passing cars.\"\n\n(Alliteration and obscure allusions, anyone?)\n\nSo, all in all, for me it was not a bad read but not one that will stick with me for very long. By the time I got to the end, I was more than ready to move on to something else.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I own about 12 versions of the novel on DVD, and this one is the best by far.  It's the closest to Shelley's original novel; the few additions made don't detract from the spirit of the novel and don't distort (as Branagh's version does) her themes or characterizations.  What I love most about is that the creature is quite young and, while still horrifying, not so monstrous as to make us forget that Victor intended to create a beautiful being (i.e., you can see the potential handsomeness despite his sickly hue and a few visible scars).  His youth makes it easier to understand that the creature is initially an infant, despite his stature--one abandoned by his \"father\" and left to learn from the random persons and experiences he comes across.  All this makes it easier to empathize with him and to ask the question: Was it his inate nature or the lack of nurture that made him into a \"monster\"?  My only real quibble is that while Donald Sutherland gives a fine performance, the difference between his and Walton's age and Victor's takes away from the doubling Shelley intended.\n\nOK, a lot of this review sounds pretty academic.  Let me say that it's an exciting production of Frankenstein, very enjoyable.  My students laughed their way through Branagh's version and definitely thought this was the best one I showed them.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.58}, {"id": "211220", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nReceived my 2013 Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar the other day, and thought I'd put together a quick review for those who might also be considering getting one.  As with the previous Lego Star Wars Advent Calendars, one of the best parts about this one is that it included NINE mini figures (including the EXCLUSIVE Santa Jango Fett figure).  In addition to this exclusive figure you get, Young Boba Fett (nice that they kept the family together for the holidays!), Scout Trooper, R5-F7, Rebel Commando, Clone Trooper, Battle Droid, Geonosian Pilot, and FA-4. I'm a big fan and avid collector of Lego Star Wars Mini Figures, so it's great to see so many figures again. And, I think they did a nice mix of original trilogy and prequel (though I always prefer more original trilogy when possible).\n\nYou also get some new and nice new ships etc. from both the original trilogy and the prequel. I'm always amazed how they can make some of these ships/items look so good using so few small pieces each.  Not always perfect, mind you, but always good enough that you can tell what it's supposed to be (and often much better than that).\n\nSince there were a lot of complaints about the fewer pieces and higher price in last year's, I thought I'd also note that the Lego 2013 Star Wars Advent Calendar increased the number of pieces and decreased the price this year (last year there were 234 pieces and the MSRP was $49.99, this year there are 254 pieces ant the MSRP is $39.99). This is more in line with the first (2011) Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar (which contained 266 pieces and also had an MSRP or $39.99), and feels more reasonable in general, especially when you can sometimes get it on sale for even less than this.\n\nSo, whether you collect Lego advent calendars, Lego Star Wars sets, Lego Star Wars mini figures, or some combination of these, I think you'll find something worthwhile about this set.  Not to mention they are a blast to open when the holidays finally get here (I've really enjoyed it the past two years, and am glad I'll get to make it three years in a row).\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

The box is the SAME size as last year, the set contains 32 LESS pieces as last year, yet it costs $10 MORE than last year.  A very poor combination without a doubt (especially given that last year's Star Wars Advent Calendar didn't sell very well and was available on clearance just about everywhere after the holidays).  But, in spite of that I couldn't risk not having a copy of what is otherwise a very cool Lego set in my collection.  I had a blast opening mine last year, and am looking very forward to opening this one this year.\n\nNext I'm going to list the set contents, so please skip the next two paragraphs if you want to be surprised.  But, since most of this info is available in the Amazon photos or easily obtainable online, I thought I'd also provide it hear for those who are interested.  Note, I purposefully list everything in alphabetical (and not chronological) order so as not to spoil the surprise too much. Not to mention the fact that I'm waiting to open mine and don't even know the order of appearance myself at this point.\n\nDepending on how/what you count, the set includes nine mini figures.  The obvious appeal of this new set are the two exclusive Santa Darth Maul and Snowman R2-D2 figures.  On top of that you also get Gungan Warrior, Hoth Rebel Trooper, Imperial Officer (Hoth), Rebel Trooper, Snowtrooper, Security Battle Droid, and Super Battle Droid.\n\nOther surprises include: AT-AT Walker, Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator, General Grievous' Starfighter, Gonk Power Droid (may also count as a mini figure to some), Gungan Shield Set, Gungan Submarine, Guns and Lightsaber, MTT, Naboo Flash Speeder, Naboo Royal Cruiser, Naboo Starfighter, P-Tower Turret, Separatist Shuttle/The Lapiz Cutter, Super Star Destoyer, and Vulture Droid.\n\nSo, there seems to be a bit more of a focus on the prequel this year, but still a sufficient amount of original trilogy stuff to keep just about everyone happy. And, while a few of the models leave a little to be desired, I also impressed at how well Lego is able to make a good representation of many of these items with so few pieces.\n\nI agree that $49.99 is a very expensive price tag for this set (it make so little sense it almost seems like it could be a mistake). And, I hope for everyone's sake that it comes down before they run out (preferably before the holidays, but even after would be fine if everyone who wants one is able to get one).  But, like I said earlier, I had so much fun opening mine last year I decided to splurge and buy at least one copy of this year's Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar to be safe.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 2.0}, {"id": "211221", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nPurchased for my 3-year-old grandson.

And solid enough to withstand the force a toddler boy puts on pieces he feels should go together, even though they obviously don't. :) Despite the hours of abuse, the puzzle pieces are all intact (they're wood), and the picture is still clear / not scratched at all.\n\nI saw a few reviews where people complained that the puzzles were so small.

Very durable, good sized pieces for them to handle, and a simple design on each puzzle for them to learn to look for visual cues on what piece they need (i.e. I'll ask him \"where's the rest of the tree?\" and he can easily spot the piece he needs.)\n\nFor parents who hate sorting stuff, you're safe.

Our setup consists of a Motorola broadband modem wired to a Linksys Wireless-G router wired to the two computers in the study. There is one wireless access point in the den, as well as a new, third computer, which connects to the wireless network via a Linksys WMB54G Music Bridge (I'll explain).\n\nLast Christmas, I bought the Linksys Music Bridge for my parents, with the idea of broadcasting music to it from the computers located in the den. I had read about the problems encountered with trying to make it work, but I saw it as my only real option at the time and decided to risk it. Following some of the user-created tutorials here and elsewhere on the net, I managed to get it working for periods at a time. I say periods at a time, because inevitably, it would lose connectivity and the bridge software would not be able to pick it up, requiring me to tinker with it to try and reestablish a connection. Recently, it seemed to stop connecting altogether.\n\nI read about the Apple Airport Express, so I picked one of those up. I brought it home from Best Buy and plugged it into a socket just behind the main entertainment system's cabinet. It has one light that blinks amber if there is a connection issue or solid green for an established connection with the network. Going through the configuration routine a couple times, I was able to get it to connect to our wireless network without nearly as much trouble as I had 8 months prior with the WMB54G. The only drawback to the Airport Express is that you can only access it with iTunes, which, when an external speaker connection is detected, creates a dropdown box in the lower area of the main window that lets you select which external speakers or Airport you would like to output to. To me, this felt a bit limiting, but I would probably have lived with it, had I not encountered an anomaly:\n\nNow, I was planning to junk the WMB54G, but we had just bought a third computer (den), which of course needed a way to connect with the network. On a whim, I plugged it into the Linksys Music Bridge. Lo, and behold, it was able to use the Music Bridge like a wireless modem! (so it wasn't a total loss, after all). However, opening iTunes, it was somehow unable to see the Airport Express, and despite my efforts, I never could get the dropdown box to appear. I wasn't about to have a 2/3 solution, so back the Airport Express went. I scanned the isle, and there was the Roku M1000. It looked promising and well-made, so I bought it.\n\nI cannot describe how cool this thing is! Setup of the Roku M1000 to the network was a real pleasure, for a change! In the first place, all setup configuration is performed at the Roku itself, using the remote and the display, which sure beats the heck out of going through a setup routine at every computer on the network! The Roku is an electronic Einstein compared to the others. It found and displayed the network name on the screen. I told it to connect. It immediately acquired all the right IP/gateway information without me having to baby it. Awesome!\n\nSecond, the Roku is smart enough to be able to scan for and find music sharing servers on the network by itself, without any additional software installed on each computer. I have not tried WMP specifically yet, but so far, whenever I have had one or all of the computers running iTunes with sharing enabled, the Roku would always find and display their library names on the screen. Sweet! Then it's just a matter of choosing one, and deciding which browsing method to use. That simple! It also will connect to hundreds of internet radio stations, right out of the box! So, even if you have not set up a music collection on your PC, you can still use it. It also shouldn't be overlooked that, unlike other devices, you don't have to go to the computer to play music from it. Since the Roku has its own display, you can browse and change the music right there, using the remote.\n\nWhen I contrast my experiences regarding other devices, such as the Linksys Music Bridge and Apple Airport Express, both of which are more limiting and more prone to setup issues, with the Roku M1000, I feel that everyone wanting to get music from their PCs to their home stereo system should be made aware of this little guy, as it is by far the easiest and most versatile solution out there.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I recall some people complained of long download times. Please make sure that the Ethernet settings are appropriate for your home network, as the default connection speed is only 56k. I have mine set to 768k (sounds right) and the downloading process took only 20 minutes, approximately.\n\n*cracks a can of Red Bull*\n\nahh, where was I...\n\nOh yes. To connect to your home network router, first connect a suitable ethernet (cat5) cable to the A35 and the router. For me, the router is two rooms away and I didn't want to be bothered with going out and buying a wireless modem for the dvd player before I know it will be worthwhile, so I retrieved my 75 foot long cat5 cable and ran it from the router to the player up above the TV. This was necessary, as I do not have an appropriate video-in on the computers to view the setup screens. I realize not just anyone has a 50+ foot long cat5 cable laying around, so you will need to do the needful so that you can be connected to your router and have access to a television.\n\nNow, power up the A35 and go into Ethernet. The user's guide is very clear on how to do this, and worked for me just fine. Set DCHP to on and DNS to on (DNS is obtained via DCHP). Press confirm and wait a few seconds. If your IP address changes to one that seems correct (such as 192.168.1.102 or similar), then press OK to accept the changes. It is OK if your gateway is 0.0.0.0, at least it was for me.\n\nPower off the machine. Wait a few seconds. Power it back on.\n\nNow choose General->Maintenance->Update and run through the OK screens (license agreement or w/e that is). The player should now see the update server and will display a message that it is updating and to not power it off. Sound advice.\n\nWith a decent cable connection, you should be done in half an hour. The player will power itself off when the update is complete.\n\nTurn it back on. Do not worry about setting the time (again). There is a setting in the menu to have the player obtain time/date settings automatically via the network. Since turning that feature on, it has stopped nagging me with the set date screen on boot up.\n\nUnfortunately, I am still waiting on my Samsung LNT4069FX to arrive, so I cannot comment yet on upscaling. However, I just put in my widescreen version of Conan The Barbarian (a never-endingly great classic) and it works and looks just fine.\n\nBoot time is about 30-35 seconds, well within reason. You're only going to notice it if you forget to power on the player until the last moment. Make sure it's the first thing you do before pulling the film, grabbing drinks, getting comfy, etc.\n\nThe remote seems well-made and is very functional. There is a dedicated slow-motion button that shifts between 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8th speed frame rates. There is also a dedicated frame-forward button when paused. It has a very robust repeat system, which can repeat All, Title, Chapter, or point A-B.\n\nThe inclusion of TV controls (channel, vol, source, mute, power) on the remote is very nice and putting in the code is a cinch with a dedicated TV CODE button.\n\nThe user guide is very clear and informative, although I do not see anything regarding the persistent storage (128MB). It seems to be used for storing content downloaded from the internet that pertains to your movies, or for future feature upgrades to the player itself (from the A2 product description).\n\nAllegedly, the resume function only works on standard DVD and only if you keep the disc in the player. It clears the memory if you open the tray. Since all the HD-DVDs I have are going to be used as presents, I'm hesitant to open one for testing. I will take their word for it, though, as I've seen other users complain of resume not working.\n\nI wish the USB port was functional already for playing images or video (divx, h. 264), but that's a minor point, as I'm going to be connecting one of our computers to the LCD tv when it arrives via an extended S-VGA patch cable.\n\nOverall, this thing seems to be working fine. I will give an update once the Samsung arrives and I have had a chance to test it out.\n\n<rant>\nOh, and don't support Sony's proprietary Blu-ray format - they are already controlling too much of the entertainment industry as it is. The PS3 is a trojan horse attempt to establish a blu-ray infrastructure so that everyone who owns one will be coerced into buying Sony blu-ray discs by default. Very, very clever marketing strategy. I like Sony, but I don't approve of the way they are trying to manipulate and control all sides of the industry, from production, to the disc format, to the players themselves. They are going for it all, perhaps, partially as vengeance for their failed BETAMAX format. I like the idea of the hard coating (not the extremely thin layer of plastic), but I just don't think it's a good idea letting Sony rule all aspects of the film/entertainment industry, a monopoly in their own right. HD-DVD, with more layers, has a potential of around 140GB, which is more than enough for anything in the near future. Also, there is the new holographic technology coming out. So stop thinking size is all that matters between formats, because it's not; keeping Sony contained, so that prices are more competitive, is what matters.\n</rant>\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 3.56}, {"id": "211224", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI can not say enough about this book.

The varied yarns are crisp works that feature her irony, winsomeness, wit and keen eye for detail. However, what is most beautifully rendered are her picturesque depictions of the lives of the backwoods folks who live in the scrub and hammocks of central Florida.\n\nIn such a hard scrabble existence, conniving is often a used attribute from the human personality. However used it may be repercussions often follow suite, as evidenced in the first story \"Cracker Chidlings\" whereby a slick willy character named Colonel Buxtom takes advantage of a widow in order to steal her property, but he gets his comeuppance for his own folly. Then there is \"Jacob's Ladder\" a wonderful story depicting the lives of Florry and Mart, two inexperienced youths who march out into the rough and tumble world which they are ill equipped to handle. What they do have is their love for each other and their simple value system, which gives them their profound dignity. This is not a tale of man against nature, but rather, man against man, and who cannot identify with that struggle? Mart and Florry are pummeled by man and nature and with the loss of their baby, but they do carry on. And in the end, they come back to Florry's broken down cabin in the woods. A compromise must be agreed to, and it is eventually reached.\n\nAll the tales have a deep rooted earthiness to it, whether it stems from the pleasure of cockfighting, as in the story \"Cocks Must Crow\" or the struggles of getting a successful bean crop to grow as in \"A Crop of Beans.\" The characters are not endowed with the accoutrements of a luxurious lifestyle, for more often than not, they are struggling for their very lives, but it is their unity as couples against the vanity and materialism of society that makes them all so noble. They have their priorities in place and no matter haw rattled they may get with hunger, varmints, dire poverty and corrupted outside influences, their inherent down-to-earth stick-to-it attitude makes them somehow prevail against the ills of an opportunistic society. And the latter element does breach into the raw Florida wilderness more often than not. It even overpowers the characters, too.\n\nEach story is a classic literary gem, and it is understandable why many writers at the time applauded Rawlings for her shorter fiction, for she did bring the form back into the national literature. Though here themes are universal, and that is how she liked to be viewed, to me, she will always be a regional writer, like Faulkner and Erskine Caldwell. There is a lot to see in a hamlet, and Marjorie Kinnan Rawling really did put the people and environment of Cross Creek under a loving microscope.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It goes on and on.  The novel was written when the belief of agnosticism was in the early  stages of being in 'vogue.' Also interesting, Darwin's Origin of the  Species had been published for some time, and the theory had rooted itself  in many areas of society.\nThis was not the traditional Victorian  novel that was written in the old English 'bonne bouche' manner on par with  Jane Eyre or Emma. The prose of the novel has a broken up fluidity to it;  it is not grandiloquent; it is in fact, quite brutal, edgy. As Elaine  Showalter writes in the excellent introduction to the Bantam Classic  edition, \"Readers expecting the structured plot of a typical  three-volume Victorian novel were startled by the oddity of African Farm,  with its poetic, allegorical, and distinct passages, and its defiance of  narrative and sexual conventions.\" With that clearly explained, it is  not a surprise that it shocked old, priggish Englanders with their stiff  upper lips and staunch, conservative manners, nor is it shocking that the  Church of England called the novel \"blasphemous.\"\nAfrican  Farm details the lives of three key characters: Waldo, Em and Lyndall. The  latter character is the one who seems to bring up the key issues that made  the novel controversal. Lyndall is always described as 'little,'  'delicate,' 'like a doll,' 'a flower.' However, she is the one who refuses  to marry (with one minor exception to the rule) until a social equilibrium  is established between men and women. She desires equality between the  sexes, and is willing to suffer for it. And she does, more than what is  expected. Odd as it may seem, but considering the period in which the novel  was written, the character of Lyndall really had to be physically  'feminized' in order to make up for her strongly held convictions of being  a 'total' woman and not 'half' a woman.\nIf any person reads the novel,  the character of Lyndall needs (from my view) special attention, for she  questions the values of men, women who accepted the standard, religion and  the social hierarchy in which she was born. Her questions seem like  cartels, challenges. Why can't she have a job? Why can't she be educated or  independent without the stigma 'weirdo' unflinchingly attached to her? Why  must she be dubbed 'strange?' The reader must always ask why when reading  this book. The three characters, Lyndall especially, endure a lot of  hardship, a hardship that mirrored the very author's life, i.e. her cold  and distant upbringing, the religious retraints placed on her life as well  as the life-clenching grasp that old norms had on women of that period.  African Farm was Olive Schreiner's liberty, her freedom from the societal  choke hold.\nIn conclusion, the novel is not one of grace and  patrician dogma. It is not a book of nice ladies and gentlemen sitting  under the African sun near exotic, wild flowers sipping tea and  participating in intellectual banter. No, it is an underscored work of  literature where ideas of human aspiration and ecumenical desires are  explored under a blazing sun and burnt, sandy plain.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.15}, {"id": "211229", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI love this game!

These little earbuds are obviously not made to last.\n\nAfter just a few months of use, the ear buds are broken. The volume up button no longer activates so you can not adjust the volume. Unfortunately I figured this out after trying to adjust the volume and turning it down more than 1/2 way. Now I can't get the volume back up and they are pretty much useless. This is disappointing because I really liked the item but I thought they would have survived more than 20-25 uses. Good design but poorly made.\n\nThere is a lot to love about these little buds. The fit in the ear is superior to any other buds, wired or wireless, that I have owned. They sit comfortably yet firmly in the ear. These are great for running or cycling. They stay in place and wick away sweat well. They are also easy to pop out with a little handle on the top of the bud. The sound quality is really good. It is not quite as good as some of the high dollar wired buds I have but they are close. There is a good amount of bass and the range of sound is very good. The sound clarity is excellent. I would say that the buds could have slightly better range. When cycling, the signal would occasionally stutter but as you get going the Bluetooth seems to sync a little better and you get pretty consistent sound. The microphone works well and shields noise from wind nicely. I have taken calls on my bike and people on the other end have been able to hear me clearly. The buttons on the bud are well thought out and you can easily find them while running. These charge off of a standard micro USB...so compatibility is great.\n\nIf I had one complaint about the ear buds it would be battery life. They claim that you can get 6 hours of consistent use out of them. I have not had that experience. I would say I can get maybe 3-4 hours at most out of them without a charge. That is fine most of the time, but on those century cycling trips or long flights I wish they held a little more juice. I bought two sets of these, one for my wife and she has not had the battery complaint I have so maybe I got a pair with a less effective battery. Regardless, given everything else these are a great little set of wireless buds and I would definitely buy them again.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.39}, {"id": "211232", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nvery nice looking and strong, it serves it purpose very welll, I have it outside on the patio and does shows rust but we're abusing it outside with the Florida Sun and rains.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

So far I've only tried it on my car, and it worked flawlessly.\n\nI recently replaced my car battery so it was near a full charge, but the GEN Mini hooked up quite easily and had my battery fully charged within a minute.  To charge a battery, it is very important that you do NOT connect the AC power plug to an electrical outlet.  First you must connect the positive (red) cable to the positive (red) battery terminal, then connect the negative (black) cable to the negative (black) battery terminal.  Lastly, now you can safely plug the AC power plug to an electrical outlet.  To indicate that it's charging, the GEN Mini will show a solid red light on the front, and when it's fully charged it will be a solid green color, also on the front of the unit.\n\nError codes:  if it's blinking orange, that means the battery terminal connections have been connected incorrectly, so at this point you want to disconnect the power plug, switch the cables to the correct setting as mentioned above, then plug the power plug back in.\n\nIf it's blinking on all lights, that means that the battery cords are not connected at all, or there could be something else wrong.\n\nI like the fact that this is waterproof, which is especially good for the winter time in my case, although this would also be ideal for boat batteries and rainy areas.\n\nThis charger comes with 4 screws which you can use to fasten this unit to a wall, that way it's secure and always ready to go.\n\nIt's small and light weight but is built very solidly so you know this will last a long time.\n\nThe main downside is that the eyelet terminal connectors are rather small, so for connecting it to a car battery, you have to try to nudge the eyelets inside or in between the metal parts of the battery's positive and negative terminals, and make sure they're not loose before proceeding to charge.  It took a little time to get the eyelets situated right, but once I had them connected, it didn't budge until it was done charging.\n\nThe only other downside is that this charger requires an electrical outlet, so it's not designed to be mobile in a car, there's no independent power source, something to keep in mind before buying this.\n\nAll things considered, the pros heavily outweigh the cons and I strongly recommend this unit for a garage, storage shed or boat house.  It's loaded with electrical safety features to prevent accidents, such as protection against reverse polarity, short circuit, open circuit, spark proof, overheating, over-current and overcharge protection, along with a host of other safety features, not to mention it charges twice as fast as average car battery chargers.  This unit is about as good as it gets for what it does.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It requires two AAA batteries and the lock for the battery lid can be a bit tricky.  It opens easily but at first it can be a little difficult to close and can require more force than with similarly shaped electronic devices, such as a remote control, but not so difficult as to be a real obstacle.\n\nOnce set up, it's fairly intuitive, one button is for choosing the correct mode, such as car, house or star (each mode is arbitrary and interchangable), then the other button is for starting the journey.  Once you've pressed the start button, then you want to shut it off to save the battery life, and whenever you've reached your destination, you turn the device on, and voila, it'll automatically point you back in the right direction from which you came, plus it will tell you how far you have traveled.  When you first turn it on, however, you have to wait for the satellite dish symbol to stop blinking, which means that it has found its GPS coordinates, and depending upon where you're at, this time can vary in length.  Staying outside of buildings will give you a faster response.\n\nIt also has a compass that's easy to navigate and it allows for a reset in case you feel it's off kilter.  To reset the compass you simply turn it on then move it several times in a horizontal, figure 8 shape, and that's it.  Beyond that it's a rather straight forward, utilitarian compass, although one disappointing feature is that it doesn't give each direction such as north, south, east and west, it simply has an arrow that points north, and it also gives you the compass degrees.  For the novice, it would have been nice to have all 4 directions indicated since not everyone knows that a compass always points north.\n\nAnother cool feature is that it has an automatic shut-off setting of a few minutes to preserve the battery life, and it won't accidentally turn on since you have to hold the power button down for a few seconds to turn it on.\n\nIt's ruggedly built so it'll withstand bumps and falls, and looks like maybe even water but this I don't dare test nor is it mentioned in the instructions.\n\nThe only major downside I've found is that if you're surrounded by concrete structures or thick walls deep down in a building's basement, the GPS locator does not work, something to keep in mind when you're using this.  I suppose this might be considered a given or common sense if you will, but again, not everyone knows how these devices work so just an fyi for the potential buyers out there.\n\nOverall, a handy little tool for your average city trip, Sunday drive or sightseeing, but I wouldn't recommend it for the hardcore adventurers.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.92}, {"id": "211234", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nElizabeth Camden once again takes a historical social issue, the treatment of tuberculosis and patients living with the disease, as her focal point in this new novel.

Bane, bad guy turned respectable hero, meets Ms. Lydia Pallas, an obsessive compulsive young woman who has a successful career as a translator and analyst in the Boston Naval Yard in the late 1800s.\n\nLydia strives to maintain the perfect world she has created for herself since coming of age after a rather rough start in life. She is a bright, educated woman very forward thinking for the time period. She presents herself as an interesting, multi-layered woman who interacts very engagingly with the charming mysterious Bane.\n\nThe story delves into the opium trade during this time period and the lengths that people went to in order to maintain the very lucrative business of shipping and distributing opium. The historical element is interesting and detailed throughout the story.\nThe plot engaged my interest and I really wanted to keep reading. The romance between Bane and Lydia is secondary to the main story, which carries messages of faith and forgiveness. It is not often that you find a hero that has been a drug dealer in another life and a heroine, who struggles with opium addiction. Very interesting concept!\n\nI would definitely recommend this book to readers of historical fiction and inspirational fiction.

The die cast body is well made and the frame is tough. The large rubber wheels are sturdy and the metal axles run through through diagonal slots which give the truck some basic suspension.

It has been dropped, drooled on, poked, hit, smashed, dragged, and generally mistreated by a two through 4 year old and has survived it all. We took it on a trip to Europe with us so that it would occupy our son during the flight and it was a godsend.

If you need a tough portable DVD player that will take a beating this is it.

Shortly, after the attack, Jenny and her parents end up attending therapy sessions with a local psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Forrester.\n\nBut her father had wanted revenge, justice But her mother never looked back\nJenny had no memory of the rape, but the terror lived in her body\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of the local psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Forrester telling the story to the reader. At first, I wasn't quite sure who was narrating, but after a few chapters it became apparent that it was the therapist who was telling the story. The reader is fortunate to sit in with each family member as they receive therapy and slowly their stories reveal intriguing back stories, their childhood traumas and secrets that are at the centre of the novel.\n\nThis psychological thriller was like no other novel I have read. The pacing was steady, and information was revealed on a need-to-know basis. But most of all, the flawed characters are well flushed out.\n\nI voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book. Many thanks to Wendy Walker, St. Martin's Press, for my ARC via NetGalley.. This is the first novel I have read by Wendy Walker and I will certainly be looking for more of her work.\n\nI will be thinking about this book for days to come!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It is a gripping story about a woman who was attacked, and fought her perpetrator from being raped while she was sleeping in her bedroom having been left alone while her husband was away on business. This novel is written in the first person, and shows the aftereffects of this thwarted attack; the residual panic feeling of being always watched and dealing with the fears of this traumathat he is coming back to get her!\n\nLaura Holland a freelance journalist living in Atlanta, Georgia had been suffering from recurring nightmares, and her husband, Chris, a medical sales engineer, doesnt know what to do to make his wife feel safe again. He makes an appointment for Laura to see, a psychologist, Barbara Cole, and she agrees to go for therapy.\n\nIt was through her therapist that Laura was introduced to Barbaras good friend and colleague, Thomas Bennett, a criminal defense attorney. Laura decides to write an article on self-defense and in particular, what would have happened if she had killed her attackerwhat would the legal ramifications be? For this assignment, Laura convinces Thomas to act as a consultant, and explain the laws of self-defense. I found it very interesting and educating to learn more details about the legal process.\n\nI still have this vivid picture of him running away. I could see a red circle on the back of his T-shirt. It was like a bulls eye that I wish I could have shot.\n\nBut Laura still feels that she is being watched! Who can she trust!\n\nI really felt for Laura for what she had gone through. This was a well-written debut novel with well-developed characters.\n\nI voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.

Pulverising power  chords give way to ragged slower numbers, which in turn collapse in upon  themselves and burn unquenched for a thousand years. It's as if Veruca Salt  took everything that was ever fresh and good about rock'n roll and somehow  blew it to smithereens spread the remains across the songs on this  record.\nThis is easily the best rock album in recent recollection... at  least since the early 90's. It sounds so vital, as if it just *had* to be  made. There's not an ounce of fat on the whole record. Metallica wishes  they could still sound this tight, furious and chaotic all at once.

I'm an experienced programmer (C# and I have had experience with C++ a few years back, but nothing too serious), so it's hard for me to judge this from a beginner's perspective; however, my experience gives me a bit of an insight into what a book should include and how the material should be structured.  I know what I want to get out of a book and so it makes it easy for me to judge whether that requirement has been fulfilled.  I must say that this book has managed well in every aspect.  It does a good job of explaining things well enough, without making it all too dry and boring.  Many books do a poor job of focusing too much on some topics to the point where it's unbearable to read them, while failing to cover certain topics in any reasonable detail.  I haven't had any issues with this one.  It's a pretty thick book (~900 pages of actual material) and it does a good job of putting it all together.  It feels like it was written by real working human beings, rather than some academic poindexter with no real-life experience.  There's no pointless humor and at the same time there is absolutely no attempt at sounding superior in any of explanations in attempt to impress the reader.  This book is a very easy read.  I am incredibly picky on books and it's not easy to please me -- I haven't found any faults worth of mentioning with this book.  I don't think a beginner will have too much difficulty with this book and I definitely think that experienced programmers wanting to brush up on their C++ will get a lot out of this.  This thing will stay in my library (it's a shame there's no hardcover version, I enjoy those).\n\nAs a tip to any beginners, read through the book lightly for the first time.  What I mean is that don't attempt to understand everything right away and don't focus too much on the details.  Make a note of the areas you had difficulty understanding, do a slight research to see if you can grasp it right away, but don't focus on that too much.  You'll be surprised how much of the earlier information will become clear and a second nature to you as you progress further.  Once you're done with your first read-through, go back and see if you still don't understand any of the areas you've marked down.  I'm sure that you'll be able to eliminate many of them.  At this point, focus heavily on the areas you still have difficulty with.  Of course, results will vary and not everyone learns the same way, but this has worked out very well for me.  That's how I study for everything.  I read through any material very lightly the firs time around, to get the general feeling and find the areas I'll be focusing on, and then go back to focus on those details.  This strategy helped me maintain 4.0 in Computer Science, so the results are real (but once again, it may vary by person).\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

With that being said, the book was not mean as a starter book for someone who has never programmed, so... there's that.

Wow! I fell in love with this series after reading Jungle Heat, Makela's first offering in this wonderful paranormal saga set in the jungles of the Amazon. Yes, the story is exciting, well written, original, romantic and sensual but what makes this story so special and unusual are the exceptional characters. They are captivating, engaging, intriguing and sexy. They will capture not only your imagination but your heart as well. Kyle Reynolds was not born a werecat as his friend and former colleague, Rei, was born a weretiger. He was attacked and bitten by a werepuma while working in the Amazon jungle with Rei  as a biologist. At the time, he had no idea that his friend was a weretiger but he held no blame toward him even though Rei seemed determined to blame himself. Kyle actually enjoyed his new life and heightened senses but now that he had become the leader of his pride, he had new responsibilities and a new purpose. He didn't have time to be attracted to a woman yet he couldn't seem to stop himself. Ever since brokering a peace with the village of Amazon women following the  attack on the village by the previous werepuma leader, he had been inexplicably drawn to one of the Amazon warriors, the beautiful Rubia. He could no longer deny his attraction to the enticing female - he wanted her, badly. But there were those in his pride who doubted his leadership and jealous of his strength and objected to the possible mating with the lovely Amazon. Rubia was a strong, loyal Amazon and would always do her duty for her tribe but she could not deny her feelings toward Kyle, the werepuma. She had yet to receive her womanhood - had never lain with any of the Indian men so she didn't understand the strange attraction to the handsome werepuma. She had always wanted to lead a peaceful, simple life, not to be mated to the werepuma leader which would very likely take away from her duties as an Amazon. Peaceful and quiet would be a totally foreign concept to Kyle but even that could not stop her feelings for him. Can a man and woman from two different worlds find love and happiness together? Will Kyle be able to save Rubia from those who wish to harm him,  and defeat his enemies? No spoilers here but I will say this.....Handsome courageous werepuma-check! Beautiful brave Amazonian woman-check! Danger, betrayal and hidden enemies-check! Heated attraction, romance, angst and some steamy sex-you bet! This is a stand alone short story with no cliffhanger although I would highly recommend also reading the first book of the series, Jungle Heat, to enrich your reading experience.

The story is exciting, entertaining, thrilling, riveting, romantic and sensual. The dialog is smart and well written. The characters are fascinating, captivating, intriguing, well developed and sexy. She uses these elements to weave a magical and heartwarming story as only she can about an Amazonian princess, Adara Rukan and a pure blood weretiger biologist, Andrei \"Rei\" Makarov. Rei was able to escape Siberia and travel to the United States where he began his studies in biology. He's lost his entire family at the hands of cruel human hunters and is now the last of his kind, a rare pure blood weretiger. He was not bitten or turned but was born as a pure blood with special abilities. He has traveled to the Amazon Rain Forest to continue his research. While out in the jungle in his tiger form, he saves a young woman from a puma attack and is instantly attracted to the beautiful creature. For the last 6 months he has watched and waited for the perfect opportunity to introduce himself to the beautiful woman whom he now knows is the Amazonian princess and future Queen of the Amazons, Adara Rukan. Although he has suffered a great loss as a result of human cruelty, he can not deny the attraction he feels for the brave beautiful human, Adara. And it seems after a rather painful introduction, quite literally, the beautiful princess Adara is attracted to the handsome weretiger as well. But will they ever be able to overcome ancient prejudice and practices to allow their love to bloom into a lasting relationship?

Bought several of them locally for a slightly higher price. I have seven so far as I move to LED lighting. They work well with various LED lights that we have added to our home. The trimmer setting is nice as the dimming behavior of LED lights is far from standard.\n\nI like this style of dimmer. It looks and operates like a traditional toggle switch, with the dimmer control independent of the on/off toggle. This allows keeping the dimmer at a preset level.\n\nTwo of my dimmers are used in 3-way setups, the rest are used in a single pole setup. If you are using it as a single pole switch and the behavior is backwards, you wired it wrong or installed it upside down. The switch is marked to be installed with the dimmer slide to the right of the on/off toggle. If the switch still behaves backwards, the wire on the 'same color' terminal, needs to move to the other 'same color' terminal. This will reverse single pole operation. I think people are not reading the instructions or misinterpreting the instructions.\n\nIf you have a 4-way setup, (3 or more switches controlling the same light), you need to install this dimmer at one of the boxes that has 3 terminal switch. If you open the box and the switch has 4 terminals not including the ground, you can not install this dimmer in that position.\n\nI have two of these dimmers installed in one box, this requires breaking off some of the cooling plate as described in the instructions. Under certain conditions, this will reduce the maximum rating of the switch, but nothing you need to worry about if you are just using LED lights. One dimmer and one standard switch fits fine in a double box with breaking tabs off.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Amazon price was half of my local home center price. I don't know if its my imagination or what, but the room temperature seems more steady. It could very well be, our old digital thermostat was 25 years old. While I found installation easy and straight forward, I would say this is not a project for the the average do-it-yourselfer, especially if you have heat+AC wiring and are electrically challenged. The problem for some may be that the labeling and wire colors on your old thermostat terminals may not match the new one. It helps to understand how thermostat systems work so you can be sure you are connecting it correctly. If you are not sure if you can do this, download the instruction manual from Lux and open up your old thermostat. If the installation wiring charts make sense and you are certain you identified all of your wires correctly, go ahead and buy this and install it yourself.\nThis is a small challenge to program, you need to read the instructions carefully. If you figured out the wiring, you can certainly get through the programming. Once you 'get it', its not that bad. There is a copy function to copy one day to another to speed things up. Keep the instructions handy because you won't remember how to reprogram it when you need to change the program. Speaking of instructions, it comes with a sheet, but you can download the full 30+ page manual.\nSome reviewers mentioned pulling the whole unit off the wall when opening the front panel. They are certainly putting their finger in the wrong spot. The design of the plastic housing does make it confusing the first time, but once you see the correct way, opening the front panel is effortless.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.28}, {"id": "211307", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis was not your average Christian Romance.

Being in the family with not one  but two football legends. Once you look a little deeper at someone you see how not perfect their life is. Claire had to grow up to early. Her parents were virtually nonexistent once her dad coaching career took off. So she was left with nannies and her sister,Zoey. Claire met Jackson  and Brad when they were playing for her father 23 years ago. Jackson became her best friend and they spent many hours together talking. After she was a victim of violence their relationship became nonexistent. He was sent away and she was left to deal with the aftermath all on her own. Now as an adult she has been so busy helping in everyone else's life that she has not really had one. Even now she works for the NY Giants dealing with their VIPs and manages all the people that come to the Coaches Shadow foundation. So all these years later no one even realizes that Claire has never had any kind of relationship especially after the incident when she was underage. She has become known as the Ice Queen from everyone but family and her dog. She is not sure she can even handle a relationship especially a man from her past.\nJacksons knows what happened to Claire and he was there to pick up the pieces and help her when she needed it. He has been back with the team for about a while now and would like something more with Claire but she never lets him in. Now that Brad is back with the team maybe his time with Claire is now.\nThis book is does not have as much angst in it as the first book in the series (second half). It is still a good book that deals with a bit of the violence that Claire suffered in her younger years. Claire is a strong person which is usually a deterrent to men. Jack does not seem to have an issue with all her surliness in fact he usually likes to see it.\nI was sad I didn't get to find out why he called her Legs, unless it was because he liked them. There was mention that she found out about the nickname but no explanation. All the same characters from Second half are back in this book. It's so cute to see Derrick and Ben be so protective over Claire when confronting Jackson.\nZoey and Suzi seem a bit more outrageous, if that's even possible, but still enjoyable.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

At first I thought this book would be hard to get into. It took off in the prologue but then it went to eight years later and I wasn't sure what was happening. Once Derrick showed up and the story started coming out of Zoey I was shocked.\n\nZoey and Derrick have an all consuming relationship. He loves her and she loves him. He is hopefully going to be picked up by the NFL draft and she still had one more year of college left. They promised each other that things would not change. They would stay together and be getting married....nothing would change....right?\n\nI have to say I am sympathetic to Zoey's story more so than Derricks. Zoey (despite what it may seem) is a good strong person. She was broken down and built herself back up and was surviving.  I am glad that Derrick came back looking for her because I don't think she would have gone looking for him.\nFriends and family are great in this book. There is a strong tie between Suzi and Zoey but I am not sure what that comes from other than high school. Claire and Sasha are her sister and niece and they have family bonds between them and they seem to always be there for her.\nSometimes I felt like I was coming in in the middle of a story already going on and I was playing catchup. Other times everything was right on target with the rest of the story. I am curious about Claire and Jackson so looking forward to reading the next one.\nThis is a good story and one that had me speechless a couple times.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.44}, {"id": "211324", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThe owl print was my daughter's favorite out of all the patterns.

The carefully planned execution shocks the small village, and is torturous to the bride and groom. On a day that should have been a memorable day of a new beginning; instead, brings about death. The police in Ely are not able to find any clues, and Scotland Yard send Inspector Ian Rutledge to solve the wedding day murder. Meanwhile another person is murdered and Rutledge is puzzled as to if the two deaths are related. Rutledge's post trauma from the Great War burden him, he fights the demons of his past, amongst the hardship of solving the crimes.\n\nPros:\n1. All the Charles Todd books I have loved, some more than others. They are not stories that are gruesome, nor fast paced. They are stories taking me through methods used in solving a crime. The main method is asking questions of those who witnessed, or were close to the victim. Further, during the interview, the detective must be acutely observant to body language, facial expressions, certain words used or not used. Knowledge and wisdom from previous crimes solved are advantageous. A gut feeling, a raw feeling deep inside that a person being interviewed is not telling the truth; however, evidence and a confession are the goal.\nEach of these methods were utilized in the telling of Hunting Shadows.\n\n2. I love Ian Rutledge's humanity. He is imperfect, slightly eccentric, but a great detective.\n\n3. The stories in the Rutledge series are not bogged down by \"any\" damsel in distress, nor by a love interest. The focus, and it feels good to have comfort in this, is the solving of a mystery.\n\n4. Hunting Shadows, tested my empathy for the guilty. Empathy does not negate murder.\n\n5. Character development. Hunting Shadows, covers the interviewing of a small village and farms, a variety of personality types are described. I love strong characters in a story, most of the people want nothing to do with being interviewed, they want to go on with their life as before, but a death changes everything. Not all the characters were at \"face value\" some hid their evil. While reading the mystery I had fun trying to decide who was the murderer, or who was guilty of past crimes, or who was hiding information about their life they didn't want anyone to know.\n\nCons:\n1. We hear the thoughts of the murderer at the beginning of the story, I would have liked this to continue. I'm aware Inspector Rutledge is the main character, but it would have peeked my interest a bit more to \"hear\" and follow along with the murderer.\n\n2. The ending drags on a little to long, I was anxious for the revealing of who the murderer was.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

A young adolescent who carried out horrific torture and murder is an anomaly to me. I hear of young people planning and taking part in petty crime, but hellish victimization? Further, the brutal torture of young innocent children? I felt a curiosity to try and comprehend a human that had a malevolent dark side (if possible), and I wanted to understand how the detectives solved the case.\nFirstly, the author has a writing style that I'll call \"multi-tasking.\" Montillo does not just write about the main subject, which is Jesse Pomeroy. Several topics are explored, each of them are linked, some links are loose and some strong. The other topics are: the Great Boston Fire of 1872, geography and history of Boston, criminology in the mid to late 1800s, 19th century psychology, 19th century journalism, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Herman Melville, history of the insanity plea, and the serialized published crime story. For some readers a \"multi-focus\" in a book is too much, for me, and because I am a \"multi-tasking\" reader, I loved this books approach.\nLastly, did The Wilderness of Ruin answer the following questions:\nWhat kind of person was Pomeroy?\nWhat made him a killer?\nYes, and it was expressed most vividly through an interesting source. The source was a writer who was approved to visit Pomeroy. This writer was an astute and discerning observer of people and life. His view of Pomeroy was not shadowed by any preconceived judgement, but an honest assessment.\nSource: Free hardcover copy from William Morrow in exchange for a review.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.61}, {"id": "211329", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nUnfortunately for \"American Gangster\", it tells a story within a genre that has provided some of the richest contributions to pop culture over the last half century.

Even if it lacks a deep story or meaningful characters, \"Starship Titanic\" still has many things going for it.  For starters, it's a short book, clocking in at a reasonable 256 pages and it reads very fast.  Second, it was written by former Monty Pythonite, Terry Jones (in the nude, no less, according to the introduction), which gives it such and absurd, off-the-wall effect that one cannot help but be amused and drawn in by this book.\n\nThe story of a wayward luxury spaceliner that finds itself (and a few unwelcome passengers) transported from its planetary system to the one that houses Earth.  Some earthbound humans end up boarding the ship for the adventure and then try frantically to get the ship to take them back home when they realize it's leaving Earth.  On top of that, saboteurs from the other planetary system have planted a super-deluxe bomb aboard to destroy the ship.  The humans want to get back home, the designers of the ship want to prevent the bombing to save their economy, and everyone is trying to figure why they can't seem to get an upgrade to First Class even though they're the only people on the ship.  It's unbelievable the level of absurdity that takes place in this book, but there is no doubting how much fun it is.  There is a space battle against a species that tries fix everything it damaged after a battle even though they don't fire weapons that can do any damage; there's an intriguing sexual encounter between the Journalist from the other system and a human female in the desperate seconds before they think the bomb will destroy them all and the subsequent attempts by the Journalist to get that female to repeat the performance; and then there's the bomb, itself.  Lacking a special memory crystal, the countdown for this bomb cannot by stopped.  Yet, it seems possible to distract him from the countdown, causing him to lose his place and have to start over again.\n\nHaving yet to read Adam's \"Hitchhiker's Trilogy\" (now at five books), I cannot comment as to how this little tale fits into the overall arc of that story and how it meshes with his writing style.

Now, in one place, the Star Trek and William Shatner fan can find a reference to everything that is Shatner.  His detractors will find everything they want as well.  Mr. Schnakenberg does not pull punches with his A-to-Z chronicle of Shatner's life.  He delves into the ugliness of his disputes with fellow actors (most notably, James Doohan... aka 'Scotty') and his notable difficulty in his personal life (on his third marriage at the time of this book's release and now currently on his fourth following the tragic death of his third wife).  But, he is also fair in his depictions.  He goes to great lenghts to show caring and respect that both Shatner and Leonard Nimoy have for each other despite years of tension on the Star Trek set.  Not to mention exploring the positive value of his \"Rescue 911\" TV series.  Of course, there are also many humorous moments that are documented.  Shatner's foray into the music industry with 'interesting' \"The Transformed Man\" album (now a cult hit) is covered as is one of the funniest moments in Saturday Night Live history when Shatner, playing himself, tells the assorted weirdoes at a Star Trek convention to \"get a life!\".

But, I like it that it is really true to life- with running a business, the economy, employee issues, and trying to squeeze in the time to solve a mystery with all new charachters really makes me, as a reader, feel right at home with all my favorites, the Monday Bunch, and of course, Sophie the cat; yet the plot is complete enough to move along at the perfect pace.

The details really make the reader feel like we are in the shop with the Monday Bunch!\n\nThis latest installment involves Betsy teaching punch needle at a retirement home.  When a dead body is found, and one of her best customers has a nephew un-fairly fired from the retirement home, Betsy springs into action.  Meeting the cast of characters at the home really lets us see how important activities, and needlework (I am a quilter!) are to being productive, and enjoying the creation of beautiful things is to people.  We also see our regular favorites, Godwin, Jill, Connor, and Bershada, as they band together to solve the next mystery!  Set in an old, renovated silk factory, we are moved along at a great pace in gathering clues to solve the mystery.\n\nThere are a lot of authors that do a series like this well.

The slow, ordinary plodding of the plot wasn't poor design, it was BY DESIGN, as you experienced the emotion of the characters, developed so well you entered upon their lives. You experience their story, a dull, ordinary seemingly pointless lied, peppered only by shameful memories of pain & worthlessness until, as the stories intertwine, a victorious hopefulness is found. However, in the spirit of classic tragedy, will it be too late? You find yourself racing to the ending to find out.

Since so many of the reviews have focused on picture quality I will attempt to focus this review on the less oft-covered aspects of this TV.  First off, I did not purchase this through amazon as it was only offered through 3rd parties, and I was able to get free, scheduled delivery, a lower price, and some purchase incentives through a different, respected, online vendor.  I would ensure delivery be included in the purchase as the TV when boxed is very large and unwieldy.\n\nOnce unboxed the TV is surprisingly \"mobile\" with very convenient handholds recessed in the back, and therefore a fairly easy two-person lift for normally sized/strength adults, man or woman.  I did purchase the \"Sanus VMPL3-B Tilt Wall Mount for 27\" to 84\" Displays (Black)\" for this device through amazon, and hanging the TV on the mount was fairly easy due to these recessed handholds.  It was also fairly easy to move the TV around getting a reasonable idea of best viewing location etc.\n\nI wish more of the connectors on the back recognized the likely wall-hung configurations for the TV.  Only the connectors on the side actually provided an orientation parallel to the wall.  The component connections in particular are just about on the outermost part of the housing creating a need for the TV to be at least a couple inches away from the wall unless you ensure the openings for the cables are in the wall directly behind the connectors on the TV.  For some applications this is OK, but if you happen to have source components (game system, hd/dvd player, or older pre-amp/receiver with only component video switching, etc) where the highest quality connection is component video and the cables don't necessarily run through the wall you may want to create a little more space between the TV and wall to allow cable connections than would otherwise be needed.  If you use the base that comes with the TV set on the floor or table/shelf of some kind there will be plenty of space behind the TV for even component video connections.\n\nThe overall appearance of the TV is rather understated (much like in the online pictures) with a black frame and not any very prominent logos, or shiny metal or such.\n\nThe viewing angle is nice and wide, and the room where I have it installed is subject to very big changes in ambient light (near some big sliding glass doors out to deck), and I have not had trouble viewing in any ambient light conditions.\n\nFor a bit more than $2K the price/performance on this TV is quite good, and overall image quality compares rather well to smaller LCD/LED sets.  If you have a large space &/or are likely to be viewing from multiple rooms or in an entertainment setting I would strongly recommend the larger size and relative brightness of the plasma compared to LCD/LED, and also the speedy refresh rate is great for gaming.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It also has a fairly nice channel to hold cables with a clean snap-in cover.\n\nThe reason this gets 4 stars rather than 5 is the lack of any nice housing/escutcheon to cover the mounting plate that attaches to the wall.  Compared to the thought that went into including an integrated cover for the cable channel, the omission of any trim for the mounting plate seems an odd oversight.

Yup! Never a dull moment, right up until the Lunar New Year -- oh, no!! It's well-paced, suspenseful, a little scary, and soooo sexy. The story flows, from winter in Santa Monica, California to rain-swept Bainbridge Island in Washington State, to frozen Tokyo and the cleverly conceived confrontation with evil, and finally to London, on the verge of spring.\n\nGranted, there are a few bald spots in the plot, and half a dozen typos or so, but this book is a KICK! It's a mix of Bourne and Bond, with a luscious anti-hero. I liked the first book in the series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Black-Ice/dp/B009037SD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Ice</a>&nbsp;with Chloe and Bastien, but I love this one. (Actually, Black Ice had a more textured villain, whereas this villain was a one-dimensional religious lunatic.)\n\nThe POV shifts constantly (sometimes too much) from Dr. Summer Hawthorne to Takashi (Taka) O'Brien to His Holiness, the Shirosama, guru of the True Realization Fellowship, to Madame Isobel Lambert, the Judi Dench-like Director of The Committee, a London-based covert special-ops group, and Taka's boss.\n\nThe PLOT:  Taka, a half-Japanese / half-American assassin, is conflicted about Lambert's order to kill Summer, to save the world from chemical and biological mass murder (not beyond the realm of possibility, considering the noxious gassing of the trains in Japan several years ago). Contrived! There was no need for the (mostly benign) Committee to kill an innocent citizen. They could have simply kidnapped Summer and hidden her safely away, keeping her memories and her urn from the Shirosama.\n\nBut I went along for the ride. And what a ride it was!\n\nSummer's POV:  \"Even in the shadows she could see that he was exquisitely beautiful. High, perfect cheekbones, exotic eyes of an indeterminate shade, narrow face and rich, full mouth. His hair was long and silky, black, and he was at least part Asian, despite the fact that he towered over her.\"\n\nTaka's POV:  \"She had blue eyes, and she was prettier than he'd realized. She didn't wear make up, and she had a sprinkling of freckles across her nose. He'd never killed anyone with freckles before.\"\n\n*Evil chuckle* Isn't he just adorable?! Cruel, ice cold, and eventually so damn crazy about her! It's just driving him nuts. He ties himself into KNOTS, haha, but once he makes up his mind that he is NOT gonna kill her, he goes all alpha, protective, hot, and sexy.\n\nIt's not love at first sight. Taka thinks Summer is frumpy and annoyingly stupid. And she sometimes is!\n\nHe's cruel sometimes, but then he's sorry. And so so hot! That scene in the bathroom!!! The bedroom!\n\nAnd in the end, the sweetest -melting scene, with Taka holding Summer \"so tightly a weaker woman might break, whispering to her in Japanese, sweet, loving words, letting her cry.\"\n\nAwwww!! HEA for all. Hugs all round!\n\nGreat secondary characters, especially red-haired bad-boy Reno (Taka's younger cousin) and Jilly (Summer's teenage sister), the stars of book 5,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fire-and-Ice/dp/B004PACKI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fire and Ice</a>.

The heroine of this book is Summer's sister, Jillian (Jilly), and the hero is Taka's cousin Reno, newest operative for the Committee, and another ice-cold anti-hero, but not quite as gamma as Peter Bastien, from Book 1. Jilly is 20 and Reno about 28, I think (discrepancy with book 3), so they both seem less mature than the other couples in the series.\n\nThis book is set in winter in Tokyo, and also in Los Angeles. The Committee plays only a small role.\n\nWhen the story begins, Jilly has arrived in Tokyo unexpectedly, to cry on her sister's shoulder, hoping also to catch a glimpse of Reno, the exotic subject of all her secret virginal daydreams. However, danger waits for the unsuspecting brainiac. Because of Sir Harry Thomason's residual murder contract (see book 4), Russian mercenaries are trying to kill Taka and Summer, so they are hiding away. (We see little of Summer, but more of Taka.)\n\nSo, as a matter of family honor, Reno must keep Jilly safe from the thugs who would use her as bait to lure Taka back to Tokyo. And he must keep his hands off her, having promised Summer and Taka that he won't play into Jilly's infatuation for him. Keeping his hands off Jilly, resisting his attraction to her -- that's the central theme of this book. The suspense itself is a bit over-the-top, but heh...it worked. From Jilly's first day in Tokyo, the action is non stop, as Reno keeps his \"Ji-chan\" on the run from murderous Russian hit men, and even more treachery closer to home.\n\nThey spend every second together, even sleeping squeezed together in a tube hotel. Reno has promised to stay away from Jilly, and he has every intention of doing so, but ... easier said than done! He blows hot and cold, and sometimes terribly cold, attempting to stifle his intense feelings for her. He doesn't know what's wrong with him--he doesn't do love! Only sex.\n\nIf he can just get Jilly safely out of the country and back to LA, he could move on, and find someone else to screw. Right?\n\nOver the course of this story, Reno grows up a lot, facing some heavy family issues, falling in love, even getting rid of his exotic camouflage, to large extent, by the end of the book. I look forward to seeing him in book 6.\n\nI loved Jillian almost more than Reno, which is unusual for me. I usually bond with the hero more. Jilly held her own very nicely, and did what she had to do, even killing. Loved Reno's worried concern when Jilly went into a shocked daze after she shot someone's head off (a bit graphic, eeew). Jilly stayed strong and held it together even when Reno was a complete jerk, twisting the knife to break the growing emotional bond that scared him into a cold sweat. Loved the scene in Grandfather's compound, when Jilly realized how much Reno cared for her, despite his careless and cruel words. He says \"No, Ji-chan, I don't love you\" even as he's pulling her close, ready to die for her. Haha!\n\nAs I said, the non-stop action and never-ending danger is over the top, and when evil follows Jilly home to Los Angeles, I was rolling my eyes. But what fun! Jolly good story!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 3.08}, {"id": "211354", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI first have to start off by saying I am a very quick reader. I can finish a 400 page book easily within just a few hours if I am able to get into it. With that being said, I finished this book in about an hour. I started it while I was at dinner with my boyfriend. I began reading this book by request of my sister. She  is a friend of the author and knew that I like kind of fiction / sci fi books. I'm not one to read military books or even history honestly. I can read them, but normally I find them dull and kind of boring and very hard to continue to read in one sitting and they end up collecting dust on my bookshelf.\n\nI sat down at our table and was messaging my sister. She asked me if I had read it and I had admitted that I had not. I had downloaded it but just hadn't had the chance to actually pick it up and read it. Yes it was on my phone and yes I carry my phone with me everywhere, but remember previous paragraph saying that I don't really find interest in history/war books. I had the mentality that I would just read a couple pages just to appease her and say I tried. I went into this with a basic \"what the heck\" attitude.\n\n20 minutes later.. Wait what happened to the last 20 minutes? Last thing I remember I had just ordered my drink and what I was going to eat and she's already delivering half of it to me?! What's going on here!! I look down at my phone what feels like a whole 3 seconds and shes already delivering food? What did they do back there in the kitchen rapid cook our food? I think I ate a whole 10 bites of my meal before I just gave up and continued to read. Thankfully my boyfriend had some things that he needed to read too because I don't think I was very entertaining.\n\nBy the end of the dinner I had finished about 60% of the book. We drove home and I ended up finishing the book in less than 20 minutes. I can't read in the car else I probably would have finished reading it on the way home. I am one of those poor people who get that thing called car sick when I'm focusing on something in front of my face while seeing in my peripheral vision the world going around me.\n\nTo finish the warming up to the review I wanted you to get an idea of a type of reader that I am. I love almost all fantasy books. I enjoy most romance (not too smutty though) books as long as they're well written as well as the occasional Sci Fi book. I liked the Star Wars Franchise though I was never able to get into the books. I had to break LOTR movies up in weeks to watch them though because they were too long and it put me to sleep. I haven't even tried to read the books. I read a ton though when I find an author that I enjoy as well as a book series that I just can't put down. I'm currently reading the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher (check it out if you haven't heard of it) We're just waiting for the next installment.\n\nAnyway to get to the actual review:\n\nI was a little confused at first and had to go back and reread what was going on. I didn't really read the synopsis originally when I downloaded the book because it was a request of my sister. She knows the types of books that I like to read so I figured I would try to read this \"war\" book. I got it when it was free on Amazon so it wasn't too terrible for me to try and read it.\n\nFast forward to the \"not putting it down until the last page was turned\" part. There were very few if any \"mistakes\" that I caught other than the usage of the names not being so \"German\" persay. There were some that were however I was expecting to see more names like Nikolaus or Gottfried or something. I guess a futuristic dystopia of sorts may have some of the \"outside influence\" even if they were lead to believe that it didn't exist. Heck its a hundred years into the future, who knows what the names are going to be like! The book was very fast paced and it kept you gripping the rope to keep up with everything that was going on. It definitely was a page turner that's for sure. It was one of those \"I have to finish this last chapter before I put it down for the evening\" books that you just don't ever put down until you're done. I finished the book with an \"aaaawwweee thats all!?!?!\" thought. For a beginning writer I felt it was well written and pretty easy to follow along. I was a little confused at first during some parts but after I read the next perspective then it made a little more sense. All in all I give this a 5 star review because it kept me entangled into the plot. It was a chore just putting the phone down to go home. I picked it up almost immediately the second I stepped into my door and continued it until I was finished.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a shorter read, who likes kind of war books with a fantasy twist to it. It's not terribly gruesome and overly detailed in the gorey parts, so that also makes it nice. All in all I would say this is an up and coming author who needs to be watched. He just might be the next Stephen King or Dean Koontz. The world of the written word is left to the imagination and who knows what's behind the next door for this up and coming author!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I tried to like it but in the end it is way too much of a niche bag.  Really its more of a murse than an urban commuter bag.  I live in NYC and commute on the subway about an hour each way to and from work, so having a good messenger bag is a must.  My every day carry items I keep limited (1L water bottle, micro umbrella, pepper spray, ipad, phone, glasses, bandanna, ear plugs, wet wipes, reading glasses, key ring, ear plugs).  I figured this bag would be perfect and when my old bag got a big tear I ordered it.\n\nUnfortunately, this bag is really meant for someone with very specific needs.  It has a major flaw which was a deal breaker for me.  It has a lot of pockets (11 or 12 in total) but they are all really small or really tight, including the main pocket which has a doubled cloth liner which makes it smaller and tighter than a regular main pocket.  So if you have a whole lot of flat or small items you need to carry every day, then this bag may be ideal for you.  But if you need to carry some larger items, you're going to most likely drop them all into the main pocket and let them all tangle up with each other.\n\nIt really reminds me more of a canvas OD green women's purse.\n\nPros:\nSolid construction\nLooks good (actually got a compliment on it)\nLots of individual pockets\n\nCons:\nMain pouch plastic clip broke the first day\nPouches/pockets are really tight and/or small\nClear plastic pocket seems mostly useless beyond putting your contact info\nShoulder strap was not easy to adjust\nDouble lined main pouch is a nice idea with very poor execution.\n\nLike I said I really wanted to love it, but in the end I gave up after using it for less than a week and ordered a real messenger bag.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

(Henry only sent me the review copy recently and I was previously unaware of this book.) \"As a psychotherapist in private practice...\" she writes, \"men keep coming to my office, one after another, hurting, wounded... but mostly unhappy.... They feel like they are trapped, dying somehow. They feel like little boys in grown up bodies.\" As we read the book, we come to realize that virtually all men are in some ways emotionally unavailable.\n\nHenry believes that what she calls our culture's \"tradition of teaching our little boys to cut off from their feelings\" helps create problems that interfere with men's emotional development. And so we have ended up in a situation today where \"women seem to have gained some advantage over the last 60 years. They have their emotions---little girls are not taught to cut of from that part of themselves--and they have the business world, too. Men, however, have arrived somewhat at a disadvantage. They have the business world. Period.\"\n\nThe author really grasps in a way I do not remember ever seeing concretized so particularly how women can--intentionally or otherwise--create what she calls a \"hurricane\" that is \"powerful and it is relentless,\" that shames and terrifies men and shuts them down. There are many ways to avoid the hurricane, but it is often hard for men to do as it may feel familiar from a childhood hurricane created by a raging, addicted, or overly powerful parent. Also, many ways to avoid the hurricane are dysfunctional and counterproductive--raging, overreacting, passive aggression, running away. If men can learn to face the storm, they can bring themselves into full adulthood. Henry writes that to face the storm, we need certain tools, including the realization that we are not victims, the realization that we also have needs, and the need to set healthy boundaries.\n\nJust the realization, \"I am not a victim\" can be such a powerful statement to release us into adulthood, as Henry relates it did for her. As far as boundaries go, Henry provides an apposite metaphor: \"I liken good relationships to sending a fax. You send your partner a fax and you get to keep the original.\" She then gives the reader seven detailed steps in setting and enforcing meaningful, realistic boundaries.\n\nMost of us had programming laid in at childhood that may not be serving us any more. One of Henry's more inspired metaphors: allowing your (often counterproductive) childhood programming to continue to run things is like letting a five-year-old drive your car.\n\nChapter 8 contains no fewer than--count `em!--twenty-eight suggested methods for reconnecting with one's feelings, each explained in detail. Clearly, this author really cares. Suggestion 2: Inventory your losses. Suggestion 5: Write a letter to each of your parents. Suggestion 10: Think About Your Own Children (but why does the author assume all readers necessarily have kids?). Suggestion 14: Practice One-Sentence Confrontations. Suggestion 21: Pray, Sit with Nature, Meditate. Henry earns a lot of points in my book for repeatedly urging readers to attend the Mankind Project's New Warrior Weekend, which--as is probably true for virtually every man who has done it--is one of the most important, powerful things I ever did.\n\nHenry provides a fair amount of atypical advice, as when she counsels her readers not to take items off the table. In other words, if there is some issue that keeps coming up between you and your partner, it needs to be worked out, no matter how trivial it seems, and should not be submerged as it is bound to surface later in a more virulent form. Another example is her advice not to compromise, to go for a win-win but never to agree to something just to end a conflict when your agreement is not genuine. \"Compromise doesn't work when it means we take turns losing,\" she memorably summarizes, later adding even more succinctly, \"DO NOT say yes to something when the answer is no.\" Finally, Henry believes in the occasional use of retraction, when you agree to something that you later realize just doesn't work for you and when there is an important principle at stake for you that you can't override and be true to yourself. The author provides a memorable story of how she uninvited her mother to witness the birth of her child!\n\nThis is literally a two-sided book. Start reading from one side and it's a book for men; start from the other side and it's a shorter book for women. Everything I have discussed so far is from the men's book, and really Henry's focus is on men. The women's book enables female partners of emotionally unavailable men to support their partners during the process she outlines. She does provide some memorable points in the women's book too. For example, don't wait to start your life until you have a partner. When you have a partner, neither make him your \"project\" nor live parallel lives with him. Rather, stay connected while holding onto your individuality. The author also looks at and even lists the numerous \"secondary gains\" that can hold us back from improving a relationship due to comfort and vested interest in the status quo, even though it may be miserable. She also provides sage advice on overcoming resistances, on creating safety for one's partner, and on how love in a relationship should be conditional, not unconditional (another unconventional yet wise point in her favor).\n\nSome examples fall flat or just don't seem to quite fit. But those that do are often stunning. The other odd thing I noticed is the author's repeated assumption all her readers have kids, which doesn't interfere with the flow of the book or invalidate her points but is just a bit jarring.\n\nHenry's originality means that the numerous examples are fresh, often taken from the author's own life or those of her clients (suitably anonymized of course), or even from Sea World (her example of how Shamu is incrementally changed to do the trick where he leaps out of the water is simply stunning). In a word, what is most special about this book is its sympathy for men--Henry really gets men--and its originality. This is a book not to be missed--and you can listen to it in the car if you prefer that to reading.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Many of us who may feel relatively \"in touch\" with our feelings nevertheless are periodically reminded of how much work may still remain to be done. And so it is that \"Nothing's Wrong\" has appeared on the scene.\n\nAuthor Kundtz' approach is admirable on several different levels. He is male-affirming as a matter of course. Why shouldn't he be, since nothing is wrong with men! He implicitly accepts men's ways of communicating as valid and valuable. And he draws us into his viewpoints by telling personal stories (both about himself and about suitably anonymized patients of his). These tales enable us to draw links between our own selves and others, and help demystify and break down this whole sometimes imposing subject.\n\n\"Feeling from the gut\" is what many men do, Kundtz tells us, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that either. In a wonderfully simple yet deep metaphor, the author suggests that we must learn both to be the man on the moon (heroic, externally focused) and also the man in the moon (fun-loving, internally focused). The emotional miseducation of boys and men is explained in detail. One thing that had never occurred to me before: with the feeling world relatively closed off to most of us, men may love sports so devoutly (both as participants and spectators) because the game is one of the purest times we are able to feel alive. (And so it may be with me with my own lifelong interest in tournament chess.)\n\nProbably all of us have heard it said that feelings are neither good nor bad, they just are. But no one I can recall has so deeply illuminated this simple statement, showing us the \"premoral\" nature of emotions. (Morality--and responsibility--only enter into the equation when we decide whether or not and how to act on what we feel.) As a theologian, Kundtz is eminently qualified to discuss the terror most churches (and schools) seem to have regarding feelings.\n\nStay with \"negative\" feelings, the author urges us, at least for a while. Don't deny them. If a feeling doesn't get to tell us how to express it, it will be buried alive. Besides, unexpressed feelings inevitably will emerge on their own and potentially cause at least three different kinds of damage--addictions, physical illness, and emotional illness.\n\nThe author outlines three steps to emotional fitness. \"First: Notice the feelings. Stay with it. Second: Name the feeling. Pick a name to identify what you feel. Third: Express the feeling. Get the feeling outside you.\" One problem for men is often we don't even notice that we are having a feeling!

My expectations were possibly a little high, or at least incorrect. I came to the book hearing that it was not another cancer novel. By this, I expected it not to be A Walk to Rememberin other words, not to be overly melodramatic and mawkish, to be generally more honest.\n\nThere were several problems to me with the book. The first is that Im not sure how the book could have been more melodramatic and mawkish. It is a roller coaster of emotions--trying to jar you back and forth just about as violently as it can. I think that the author thought that some occasional outbursts of cynicism and despair would cover over the uber-sentimentality of the novel, but I think that just added to it. The second is that the characters are often, frankly, childish and even sometimes mean. I guess that such should be expected--they are teens after all who live in difficult circumstances and so have a right to act selfish and moody. But at the same time, the tantrums and fits these characters display seems so at odds with the extra- extra- extra-ordinariness in everything else that they do. I know that a standard critique of the novel is that the characters seem too old for their years (how many 15 year olds can start reciting The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock), but that didn't bother me as much as how they are not more consistently mature for their age.\n\nThird, it seemed like an oddly paced book. Theres a big twist to the novel, and once it happens, everything is very, very quick to the end. I felt somewhat cheated that the development that went into the beginning of the novel, up through the trip to Amsterdam, did not carry on to the end of the book. I will say that my high school students, even though they tend to love the novel, also tend to agree with me on this point.\n\nOverall, I found this an occasionally entertaining book, a teen melodrama thats not as different from A Walk to Remember as youd expect.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I do agree with her. Of course sex is a valid topic since (whether your active or not) it is all around you. Unfortunately, even though Forever was the first book to write about sex for teens, it isn't overly well written, and it really misses its point.\nKatherine is the main character in the book. It's written from her point of view, and it is about the year-long relationship her senior year with Michael. Throughout the year, the two fall in love, she loses her virginity, and they vow to be together \"forever.\" That is, until she spends time around another guy and begins to wonder about \"forever\" with Michael. At that point in the story, it seems like Blume had actually reached a point where the characters (and the reader) could gain some type of insight. Maybe Katherine would realize that she was too immature for that relationship and too immature to face the consequences that go with a relationship? But Blume kills her one moment when Katherine goes on about not regreting anything she had done. Katherine had missed the point, as had Blume. Some of the characterizations in the novel were less than perfect, too. For instance, Michael is really suppossed to be in love with Katherine. The reader is told that but never sees it. All you ever see Michael doing is trying to have sex with Katherine. You never feel that he really cares for her, and that makes it even more ludicrous when Katherine doesn't regret anything.\nI'm giving Forever three stars on its importance to young adult literature. But really, as a work of art, it certainly deserves no more than two.\nScore:"}], "output": "3", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.43}, {"id": "211381", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nIt was interesting read.

Varying stories of after death communication between family members, close friends. I enjoyed them. It's a hopeful message for those grieving, as I believe the best resolution and peace to grief is contact with our deceased, hearing from them. The book gave a curtain call in the form of statistics that widow/widowers were the largest group of people receiving communication from their deceased spouse - 60%. A very neglected area in many books; some if not more, even on-going. The authors' mention that the deceased say they have to move on has struck me odd. In my mind, depending on the type of relationship you had with the deceased while alive, this communication seems to reflect in the after death communication/signs. Why would those on other side suddenly not be interested in love with those that death takes away so cruelly? Love, relationships, and healing are the driving force of all of us.\n\nEven though many NDEs make comments about not wanting to come back, that does not mean if they had stayed, at some point, they wouldn't want to contact those closest to their hearts. I'm sure the NDE's are a bit overwhelmed with the whole experience. Many of the older books written after Civil War and WWI bring many messages of the afterlife from the deceased, expressing their love, and their desire to make contact with their loved ones, open the doors of our minds on this side to make that possible. Reflective of the values of the day.\n\nPersonally, I'm tired of the slant that the deceased have better things to do than love us and communicate with us, which strongly reminds me of people so engrossed in themselves that they don't have time for spouse, family, friends, etc. I'm just not buying into that idea at all.\n\nThat being said, this book shows evidence of contact, some for a period of years, some to more than one family member. The book makes no assumptions about what is possible or what is set in stone. For every relationship, there are varying communications, as the book aims to exhibit. Those who do not wish for communication, it is respected. In my efforts to have my many questions answered, I have read many books on NDEs and afterlife communications, older books, Swedenborg, etc. My aim is to get a realistic perspective, since I lack the direct experience of the afterlife (as do most of us), and take the things I read, the questions I have that get answered or touched upon, (many current books do not) and make sense of it all.\n\nThis book gives a good overview using evidential information through stories of the experiencers. Why would so many people make this stuff up, especially when there are corroborating witnesses or shared experiences?

Maybe some aren't but chances are most of us would find our curiosity piqued at some point. Who doesn't want to know where we go when we die? Who doesn't want confirmation of this...that we are loved and cared for even more after death than in life (and that's risky to say for those that see we live on a dysfunctional planet where spouses and family are the cause of great pain instead of real love). This books gives stories to confirm and acknowledge that there is life after death, and its relief that it exists with love.\n\nI like these points:\nWe live in a death phobic society\nThose who love us don't abandon us just because they leave this life\nQuote by Jack Lemmon: Death ends a life, not a relationship\nA Personal Goodbye story about a soulmate married couple\n\nThe field of questions/answers seems to be around the deceased and the happy heavens, and not enough around those left behind to know the deceased are equally interested in our well-being (which would do wonders for the grieving and if we had more tools for communicating with them). It's the ones we are sad about leaving us that we need to get our comfort from. Why not? What we hear instead is...they want you to be happy. (I hear a big buzzer go off in my head when I hear people say that nonsense). No, they are concerned for our well-being while here grieving for them. If my husband goes on a trip without me, having a grand ol time, and leaves me home alone while I'm sick, he sure better not say...be happy, dear - cuz I am! No, love dictates to call and make sure the other is ok and do whatever they can to help. Love isn't about self or being wooed by shiny objects (heaven). Love is about concern for the other person's well-being, 2 ways. Refer back to Jack Lemmon's quote above. I only wish the author went into this aspect a lot more.\n\nAuthor breaks up the different aspects of spirit experiences of life after life and from people in different religions. Author spends a lot of time on the death bed visions, giving plenty of stories and examples, she still goes into after death communications for a chapter. I wish that was expanded. The book has plenty of witness accounts and stories, titling them for easy snapshot reading. I expected a bit more analysis and conclusions about the deceased. But much of her information is to help confirm and acknowledge that these things do happen and are real, as the title implies.\n\nI didn't care for the chapter of going up against the skeptics. Irrelevant to me. I skimmed it. Frankly, I ignore skeptics because I know what I see with all my senses and critical thinking to eliminate possibilities for an answer - my deceased visiting me, leaving a sign. I'm sure many other experiencers will know that as well. I'm pretty sure the skeptics live to brush off what the rest of us know we saw, heard, smelled, witnessed. Buk lernin don't meen u no everythang. Wait until it happens to them. There's a difference between using good logical steps for rational conclusions and the skeptic mentality. This skeptic chapter was the reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nI like her conclusion chapter of how we can \"Learn to See the Unseen\". I'm always interested in 2-way communication with my loved one. That's what made the love between us grow - affections in agreement of sharing together. To expect me to be okay with sudden disconnect between us because of death just seems like a cruel set-up. I don't think it was meant to be this way, but something must have changed the mechanisms to make it difficult to continue. I'm always looking for a way around what I don't find as an acceptable reality.

MacDonald's rare forays into writing a pure 'business' thriller. One of JDM's strengths is to render financial and corporate problems down to their human essences - explaining shares and dividends in terms of small towns, family homes and personal relationships.\n\nIn A Man of Affairs, the focus is solely on the lattermost point. From the set-up, JDM makes it clear that the stakes of the book aren't about life and death, or even wealth and discomfort. The conflict is about pride and ambition. How far will some men go for power, and where are the limits of self-respect?\n\nThe protagonist is Sam Glidden, an executive (not a shareholder) in a small-town manufacturing company. He owes a debt of honor to the company's founder - a debt which he maintains by sticking about at the business (despite being a 'bright young thing'). Unfortunately, the second generation of the company's ownership is not as worthy of Sam's loyalty (or are they?).\n\nThe book begins with the advent of an ambitious corporate shark, Mike Dean. Glidden and the company's current lackadaisical ownership are flown to a secluded island, so that he can seduce them into a buy-out (to be followed by a barely-legal stock inflation and unloading).\n\nThe island is filled with debauchery - 1957-style. The drinking begins at dawn, followed by sun-tanning, barracuda-fishing and prolific adultery. When the sun goes down, there's a brief and sodden discussion of business, followed by more drinking, a bit of singing and shameless bed-swapping.\n\nAgainst this background, Glidden is tempted (repeatedly) by the nubile flesh of those around him (including one of the [married] bosses) and by the generous, Faustian offers of Mike Dean. Although the conflict of the book is set up nicely - Sam vs. Mike, Sam vs. the Old Guard, Sam vs. himself - everything is resolved far too neatly.\n\nAfter positioning everything so nicely, John D. MacDonald effectively punts for the final third of the book. Sam makes tough, terrible decisions, but never needs to fret about them, as the rest of the world invariably maneuvers to prove him right (posthumously). Awkward interjections of physical violence make the conclusion all the sillier - despite Glidden's moral and intellectual challenges, his 'success' eventually hinges on his upper arm strength.\n\nThe one tiny, golden highlight of the book's conclusion is the final page. The denouement of the story is surprisingly romantic, and even a bit poignant. It does not, however, redeem the lackluster fumbling of the previous pages. This book is excellently set up, but poorly resolved - John D. MacDonald comes down with ill-timed cold feet and sabotages his own work.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

However, Michael does have an impressively absent set of moral values - he's in it for the money. An impressively manipulative societal predator, he also understands how to make himself noticed or unnoticed, to get laid or to be ignored.\n\nHis predatory cunning and mercenary ethics all add up to one profession: a hitman.\n\nAnd he's very good at it.\n\nIn fact, Michael is so good at killing that he's been recruited by a mysterious group called \"The Choir\" to do a series of hits. The prize is immense, but they're high-profile and, more importantly, messy. The dead? They keep coming back.\n\nSpurrier's style - something akin to Bret Easton Ellis' - is incredibly disconcerting. The reader is bombarded with paragraphs of Aztec gods, shopping lists, Internet trivia and instructions for building a silencer. Most of Contract is from Michael's point of view, but the occasional snippet of diary entry from his confidante Sally is enough to show us that he's a) unreliable and b) not nearly as cool as he thinks he is. The purpose of the book seems to be to pose as many questions as possible about the narrator's perceptions and then, largely, shrug them off.\n\nContract isn't an easy read. Michael is a collapsing, predatory, macho narrator who generates little sympathy - and, aside from a few clever witticisms, Contract lacks the goofy, self-awareness of The Culled. Contract is not over the top - which makes it all the more disturbing.\n\nInteresting, Contract is redeemed at the end. The sense of an Epic Supernatural Plot is largely ignored for the more human drama of Michael quest for purpose. Underneath all the layers of hallucination and distorted perception, Spurrier cleverly weaves everything together, culminating in an excellent final \"reveal\" and brilliantly-executed ending. Contract is a book about a side character, a \"disposable\" (as Michael would say) in the great scheme.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.65}, {"id": "211393", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nI really loved this whole Sweet Water Series, you will laugh with it and cry with it and sometimes you might want to punch a few characters. it is a must read series!!!!!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It's either that or too many of them have similar plotlines, i.e, something happens, woman runs away to start a new life under a new identity, tries very hard to stay off the grid but despite all her careful behavior, BAM, her past catches up to her. That is the plot (to a certain extent) of both The Marsh King's Daughter (just completed) and He Said/She Said (40 percent of the way through)\n\nSomeone had asked if The Marsh King's Daughter was similar to Room, the hit book from a few years ago that had a similar plot. In both instances, a teenager was kidnapped (Helena in tMKD was 14-years-old and Mia in Room was 19-years-old), held captive, and during captivity, gave birth to a child. In tMKD, it was Helena's mother who gave birth to the child but the novel is about Helena, not her mother.\n\nI might be one of the few people who didn't enjoy Room but that might change if I re-read it again now. However, I really enjoyed reading tMKD. It took some time to get into it but once I read about fifty or so pages, I was invested in Helena, her upbringing, and her search for her father who recently broke out of prison. Advising her husband Stephen and her two girls to head to her in-laws house, she takes off on her own to capture her father and try to bring him to justice. Even though she's forged a new identity for herself, Stephen doesn't even know about her old life, she knows that her father escaped for the opportunity to see her because she was the one that put him in prison the first time. She also knows that her father, with all of his survival skills and knowledge of the woods, will continue to evade the police.\n\nI thought it was a great book. It was well-written, compelling. I was into the characters, I was into all the details about the woods, the hunting, the captivity. I ended up a little confused toward the end, the parts about Rambo, her dog, etc. Minor things. I also didn't love how the mother was portrayed in the novel. It seemed like Helena was resentful of her mother for not \"being happy\" with her life on the marsh.\n\nI guess while I enjoyed Helena's pragmatic approach in the book, I didn't find a reason to root for her, her mother, even her father. They seemed harsh, and her mother was kind of dull, minus the time she baked a cake for Helena's 5th birthday with duck.\n\nI also thought that while it maintained a sense of suspense early on, the pacing slowed down toward the end. It seemed too drawn out and I found myself losing interest. I rounded up to four stars because Karen Dionne is a great writer.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I promised myself I wouldnt buy another book at the time, but I kept coming back to it. Finally I was able to snag it at the library.\n\nIn 1936, Albert Ellingham built an elite private school (but tuition-free!) in Vermont for children of all ages to practice their own interests, to engage in puzzles, read books, and really explore the world around them. Being a fun of mazes and riddles, the campus is also home to a multitude of hidden nooks and crannies. However, she and Iris, her mother, were kidnapped and held for ransom. Iriss body was recovered a few weeks later, but not Alices. The only clue left behind was a mocking riddle from Truly Devious, a pseudonym.\n\nDecades later, Stevie Bell has arrived on campus and is eager to solve the crime. Fancying herself an amateur sleuth, she believes that she has found the missing link to clear the alleged killers name and bring the real one to justice. Then, its onto the FBI, where her real life can begin. Before she can crack open the old case, however, she has to adjust to being away from home, learn how to make friends, and manage her anxiety.\n\nI thought Stevie was a good character. She was strong and embraced her differences, but not at the expense of belittling females who are interested in make-up or being a cheerleader  which is also what her conservative, traditional parents want her to be. I didn't care too much about the other characters. I didn't think we spent enough time with them to really gauge their personalities, and I wished that we were shown more of Janelle and Stevies friendship. Good female friendships are hard to come by!\n\nMy issue was also with pacing. The book is set across two timelines: 1936 and present day, with a murder mystery in each one. The problem was, we didn't get to the murder in the present day period until halfway through the book. I felt like in that regard, it took too long for the story to get started.\n\nI find myself thinking and re-thinking about the end. I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know, it was hard for me to really get into the book and then to come to the end so abruptly.. I guess thats why Im not sure if I liked liked the book.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n\n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 2.03}, {"id": "211398", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nVideo quality is poor.

Longer review:\n\nWhat we like:\n1. Looks. Obviously that's a big selling point with this cat tree, and the in-person appearance didn't disappoint.\n2. Assembly. The holes line up, and the bolts attach with ease. It took about 15 minutes to put together, and that was partially because the getting the first bolt in takes a little finessing for one person.\n3. Plush sides. The platform sides are squishy, which one of cats likes very much. Neither of them has slept in the round bed yet, though, so I wonder if they don't feel quite secure.\n\nWhat we don't like so much:\n1. Size. This is SMALL. I doubt cats much over 8 pounds could get a lot of use from it.\n2. Not plush all over. The fabric is really, really thin, so we're likely to add some padding to the two sleeping spots. Using the plush filling on the bed and house interior would have made this a MUCH better product.\n3. Wobbly. Even with the bolts tightened as much as we dared (you can hear the MDF creaking if you overtighten, and we were worried about splitting it), this wobbles a little when the cats jump on it. They seem to manage, but I'd worry with heavier and/or more active cats. That said, it's so short that the center of gravity is pretty low, so it's unlikely to topple completely.\n\nOne of our cats would have liked to have some sisal on this tree, but we can't ding it for that (if we wanted sisal, we should get another tree, right?).

But it does Julia Fox's book a disservice to entice readers with references to a not-entirely-historically-accurate soap opera treatment of history, like the Showtime tv series \"The Tudors.\"  The tv show is Dynasty in tights and corsets, while Fox's book seeks to tell a more nuanced, history-based summary of Katherine's life. Fox pairs the well-known Katherine of Aragon -- Henry VIII's first wife, whom he divorced (sort of) to marry the more infamous Anne Boleyn -- with the less-well-known-in-America story of her sister Juana. Most Americans remember King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella from the story of Columbus, but Ferdinand and Isabella had a number of children who survived to adulthood and populated the thrones of Europe. Katherine (born Catalina) and Juana were two of their children and both lived fairly dramatic lives.\n\nFox does a good job of setting up the action by first telling us about Ferdinand and Isabella's reign, and how their children served political purposes either as monarchs or the consorts of monarchs. We also see how Katherine of Aragon was essentially groomed to be Queen of England and how this training helped sustain her through many difficult years. By comparing and contrasting the lives of Katherine (whose first husband Arthur died within a few months of their marriage, leaving Katherine in a precarious position in England while the English royals decided whether to marry her to Arthur's younger brother Henry, or send her back) and Juana (whose instantaneous electricity with her husband gave way to his successful campaign to control and manipulate her so he could gain power over the kingdom she eventually inherited), we see how the sisters' different personalities resulted in them responding very differently to what amounts to abandonment by their royal husbands. Fox pays special attention to mythbusting, trying to get to the factual basis for many popular conceptions and misconceptions about the sister queens. (For example, Juana is known as \"Juana La Loca,\" Mad Juana, in Spain, based on her supposed insanity after her husband's death; Fox does a good job of showing that Juana was not the raving madwoman she was reputed to be, with references to her writing and eyewitness descriptions of her behavior.)\n\nI confess I'm not qualified to evaluate the quality of the research, not being an expert historian or Tudor scholar, but as a critical reader, it did seem that Fox summarized evidence fairly, noting when there simply isn't enough surviving evidence to support a conclusion one way or another. She does a good job of taking a big chunk of complicated history and breaking it down for the lay reader, and the accessibility of the book is a key strength. I suspect that true historians and those who have read reams of material about Tudor or Spanish history will find the treatment of the subject too general and superficial for their purposes, but for the person intrigued to learn more of the facts behind television's soapy treatment of The Tudors, Fox's book will prove an excellent overview of these women's lives.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Schiff does a lot of myth-busting in this book:  Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek, not Egyptian; she probably didn't die of an asp bite; and she was a far more intelligent, capable leader than she is usually given credit for.  I will let historians and Egyptologists opine as to the thoroughness of Schiff's research and the validity of the conclusions she reaches, but it seems as though she has trawled through numerous ancient texts and records to support her theories about Cleopatra's life. (The biggest criticism I have of the book is that it is densely written, with so many references to source material, commentary about said source material, and long, complex sentences intertwining on themselves, that one sometimes gets bogged down in verbiage and too much detail.) Indeed, one of the biggest challenges facing a biographer of an ancient figure like Cleopatra is the lack of first-hand source material.  When contemporaneous, primary sources don't survive, the biographer has to turn to secondary sources, many of which were written to satisfy political or other agenda, and Schiff does a good job of pointing out the difficulties in relying on these sources as she goes along.\n\nIn all this talk about sources and history, I don't want to overlook the fact that Cleopatra lived a fascinating and dramatic life,which Schiff does portray admirably (if her writing style is a bit on the dry side at times).  Cleopatra came from a long line of monarchs, and had to fight hard to obtain and keep her crown.  Schiff talks about the familial conflicts, sibling pitted against sibling, that explain why Cleopatra, like so many other Egyptian monarchs, ordered so many assassinations to secure her throne.  There are, of course, Cleopatra's relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, each of which seemed to be based both on the personal charms of the men but also on Cleopatra's need to maintain an alliance with Rome to further stabilize her hold on the Egyptian throne.  And Cleopatra's fabulous wealth and luxurious lifestyle is fascinating to read about; bowers strewn knee-deep in roses, golden barges with purple sails, lavish entertaining... it's a window into a rare and truly over-the-top way of life.\n\nDespite all of the soapy details, what stayed with me the most were the more lasting, one might say feminist, qualities that Cleopatra displayed.  She received a thorough education, the best available at the time, and was very intelligent and learned.  She spoke multiple languages fluently, no joke when you consider the different and difficult-to-learn tongues spoke in that region, and thinking about the beautiful queen able to converse as easily with slaves as with fellow rulers and ambassadors is a striking image.  She was a political survivor, using what she had to first get her throne, then keep it, while expanding her reign over large parts of the Mediterranean/Middle East.  She faced rampant sexism from many quarters, particularly from Romans who did not have a particularly enlightened view of a woman's role (and it was interesting to learn how enlightened Alexandria was regarding women's rights by comparison).  So many historians and commentators have written Cleopatra off as a sexual predator, judging her far more harshly than the men she had relationships with (Caesar and Antony were certainly no virtuous husbands faithful to their wives!) that I enjoyed reading Schiff's more objective portrayal of Cleopatra as an intelligent, ambitious, perservering ruler who, yes, probably used her sexuality as a part of her arsenal, but who should be viewed as so much more than a limpid babe in eyeliner, lying on a barge, or a scheming slut who slept her way to the top.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n\n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.5}, {"id": "211413", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nDoes what its supposed to do.

I have been looking for a replacement but hadn't quite found the one until I saw this one.

My previous stun gun was just a box shaped device with an off/on slider, and a button that I had to press to operate the stun feature. It did have a rudimentary light as well.\nNow, this Ladies Stun Gun is smart, you can use the slider on/off switch to operate the pretty bright flash light on the end, or just to turn it on and keep it ready. You can have it in your pocket or your sleeve with in your hand but you will not operate the stun feature until you actually apply force to the grip and press the trigger. I have found this feature to help me feel safe on mass transit in the new city! I keep it on and in my pocket or purse and know that if I am in a real situation I will have something to aid me. This whole trigger system makes sense as your natural reaction is to squeeze your fist and this is built for that.\nOh, and there is an alarm!

However upon receipt of the item, I can tell you, it is not a book at all. It is a binding with envelopes on each side, holding twelve, gigantic poster sized maps. The official description mentions them as posters, but I didn't pay enough attention to that. I am pleased that I have it because the maps are excellent, but at the same time I am fairly disappointed.\n\nThe maps are beautifully done, very detailed and thorough. However, I imagined this book as such with each map taking up a page, similar to atlases you might find at a gas station perhaps. I'll admit the disappointment is of my own doing since I did not thoroughly research what I was buying. So that is why I'm writing this, to perhaps help you decide if you want to buy this item.\n\nAs I said the maps are extremely well done. I can only express disappointment in the format and presentation of the media. I might also say that I expected a bit more in content. Of the twelve maps, it seems half of them are just basic duplication of another map. There is a fantastic view of the known world, a break down of the west, then central and east, etc, but I would rather see more city maps than a third more zoomed in version of the Dothraki sea.\n\nBack to the presentation: each map is a poster, and to fit it in the binding, it is folded up. Repeated taking out and viewing will prevent these maps from lasting as long as a book. So I will probably end up framing one to hang somewhere as a result. I expected to be able to leisurely flip the pages looking at the each map, but the reality is quite cumbersome. You must pull out each stack and then unfold each one, being cautious not to use haste or risk tearing. For best viewing you must have a very large table, or use your floor to spread them out.\n\nDespite all my nay-saying, I am pleased that I bought the book. I am certainly glad I bought it on Amazon at 25 dollars, over another book place that might sell it for twice that. I will reiterate again that the maps are wonderfully done, and do an excellent job of bringing GRRM's world to life.

The Divas title match between Natalya & Layla was not great but pretty good with a bad ending to ruin it. The Buried Alive match for the World's title between The Undertaker & Kane was a pretty good/solid brawl with a weird ending of the Nexus coming out and attacking The Undertaker for no good reason. The 14 man tag team elimation match between Team Smackdown & Team Raw was a good match with nice individual performances to boot. The WWE title match between Randy Orton & Wade Barrett was not by far a great match but still pretty solid with DQ ending to ruin it. Overall,good show with Ziggler vs Bryan & The 14 man tag team elimation match bring the best bouts of the night.

There are many designs to choose from but the colors of this one were my favorite. My husband asked if this was Abercrombie, as a Moose is their logo and the scarf is great quality, you would think it was a $30 scarf.

Great characters that live and breathe on the page, a really good story that holds my attention and entertains me (minimum) or one that makes me think about my own behaviors and beliefs while entertaining me (best), and vivid, strong writing.\nThis book was that. And a bag of chips. I almost read it in a single sitting and would have if I hadn't started it at 10 p.m. As a society we're geared to turn away in judgement of \"other women\" and \"mistresses\" and I'm not any different. Sure in the New Testament as Christians we know about the woman at the well and there was a prostitute in the line of Christ and all that. So I know Jesus loves the lost, and I do too, as long as they aren't making my own life messy and complicated. Like what happened to the hero in this story. And learning what happened to the heroine along the way that made her a Kept woman, and why that becomes not enough anymore. Miska's journey is an incredible one for sure, and I related so much to her in spite of the fact I'm not dating a rich married athlete and living in a high-rise in Chicago. She's real. She's honest. She's broken. I think that's true of us all, and I'm delighted the author allowed us to see that.\n\nI laughed. I got mad. I got reminded that at the end of it all, we're to love like Jesus-not only when it's messy and complicated, but especially when it's messy and complicated.

Events happen at an incredibly quick, unrealistic pace - like Nina's actions and decision-making, which seem unbelievably off the cuff and inconsistent for a lawyer. Scenes almost feel summarized and I felt like I was missing big chunks of information. The characters are more caricature than real people and there isn't much depth to the dialogue. The autopsy scene was a total joke, the men all come across as patronizing, misogynistic jerks and the women come across as rude, impulsive, slutty faux-feminists. Everyone is totally self absorbed and a couple of the main characters are painfully immature. It was hard to stay focused and make it through this book; I found myself skimming several sections. I am willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt and maybe try book 2 at some point since debuts can be somewhat rougher than subsequent books; however, there is a serious lack of follow-through within scenes and everyone is like a character in a play.

Having plenty of other Mopar (genuine OEM) chrome accents already on my truck, I can confirm that this part truly does match the OEM chrome perfectly! It installed quickly and easily (wiped the OEM handle with an alcohol pad, did a dry placement test, peeled the tape strips off and pressed it into place.. then repeated with the moveable handle cover - all less than five minutes).\n\nI have noticed that my rear view camera is a little haloed now (pictures are posted in customer images).. but it does not block any of the view that matters (on-coming traffic or pedestrians).

For one thing, it simply is not possible in 90 to 120 minutes (or in this case 98 minutes) to dramatise every incident exactly as and when it occurs in the book, nor is it ever possible to get all the humorous internal dialogue and cute thoughts that run through a character's mind.  But with a screenplay co-written by Helen Fielding (the author herself), Andrew Davies (who wrote the screenplay to Pride and Prejudice--the adaptation with Colin Firth), and Richard Curtis (The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mr. Bean, Blackadder, Notting Hill) and then topped off with a terrific cast featuring Hugh Grant, who is absolutely wonderful here in the role of Bridget's bad-boy boss; and Colin Firth, in a modern-day reprisal of his signature role as Mr. Darcy--well, the stage is set for a production that just has to be good, regardless of its faithfulness (or lack thereof) to the original text.\nIn fact, for those familiar with the novel, the film does deviate quite a bit.  Certainly, it captures the essence of the novel, and it follows its basic structure insofar as the bulk of the events that occur in the book occur also in the film.  But what occurs or what is said at these events is for the most part very different from the novel, with the character of Bridget's mom's (Gemma Jones (Duchess of Duke Street)) toy boy and thus the entire ending being completely different from the novel.\nI watched this film right after reading the novel, and I would definitely recommend against doing so.  If you've read the novel, let some time pass before watching the film, and then enjoy it on its own merits without expecting something that is too faithful to the text, for in spite of the deviations, this really is an cute film that is thoroughly enjoyable in its own right.  Just for the record, I've enjoyed this film much, much more upon subsequent viewings than I did initially!\nBriefly, for those unfamiliar with the story, it's about a 32-year-old single British woman (played surprisingly very well by American Renee Zellweger--the only non-Brit of the lot) who is looking for love but always seems to end up with commitment-phobic, game-playing losers--like her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  To make matters worse, she's surrounded by \"smug married\" friends intent on making her feel inadequate, and a mother who is intent upon fixing her up.  It is during one of those fixing-up occasions that Bridget meets the seemingly arrogant and rude Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), a highly successful lawyer and the son of her parents' friends.  From then on, Bridget seems to bump into Darcy everywhere she goes, much to her chagrin and often to her embarassment.  And that is all I shall say, for I don't wish to give things away for those unfamiliar with the story.\nIn conclusion, I recommend this film very highly to anyone looking for a fun, light, and thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy.  Familiarity with Pride and Prejudice is not necessary in order to enjoy this film--though one's enjoyment is bound to be greatly enhanced if one is familiar with and enjoyed the Pride and Prejudice dramatisation (which I recommend extremely highly).  After all, Colin Firth's original portrayal of Mr. Darcy was the inspiration for Fielding's Marc Darcy!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Wilde's gift for wit is, even now, unsurpassed, and for all the liberties taken with this film, it's wonderful to see that so much of the original wit and dialogue has remained intact.\nThe film takes place in London in 1895.  At issue is the habit some women had of idolizing their husbands--of putting them on pedestals and creating ideals out of them, with their love being directly proportional to the perceived perfection of their husbands.  The problems inherent in such a relationship are obvious; for one thing, as the film highlights, the higher a man has been raised, the harder he can expect to fall.\nThe film revolves around Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam), a Member of Parliament and \"ideal husband,\" and his seemingly faultless wife, Gertrude (Cate Blanchett).  But Sir Robert is not, of course, an \"ideal.\"  Sad to say, he is a mere mortal with feet of clay whose very marriage depends upon his wife as she discovers her husband's imperfection, her own imperfection, and whether or not she can love a man who is a mere flawed mortal.\nI don't wish to give the story away.  Suffice it to say, it is absolutely delightful and (for the most part) consummately acted.  Although the story revolves around the Chilterns, the central character is really Lord Goring (Rupert Everett), a very content, witty, idle, and carefree bachelor whose time has come to marry, or so his father Lord Caversham has decided.\nFor those familiar with the play, I must emphasise that this is a film.  It is not a film of the play.  Not being restricted, therefore, in place and time as live theatre is, justifiable liberties have been taken to create something visually appealing and exciting in a way that Wilde could never have conceived possible.  A wealth of different settings have been utilised (rather than just three), and events that were merely alluded to in the play have been dramatised (by flashback in one instance).  Though much of the dialogue is (thankfully) verbatim, it has been trimmed back here and there and occasionally has not been placed where it occurs in the play.  The gravest liberty, however, has been to remove the part wherein one of the characters uses a brooch as a bargaining chip with a certain blackmailer.  Instead the film has these two characters reaching a different arrangement, one which relies upon the outcome of a particular Parliamentary speech.  Whether justifiable or not, I did find that this alteration extended the suspense and added an additional (and quite entertaining) reason for interest in the outcome of the speech, and it was certainly a plausible arrangement in view of the proposal the blackmailer had first made.\nWhether or not one is an Oscar Wilde purist, this is a film to be enjoyed, for it is a treasure indeed to find a show that is at heart a comedy which does not descend into silliness.  At a time when most films are geared towards adolescents (or those with like mentalities), this film is a refreshing, delicious treat--a witty and wonderful feast for the intellect.  Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the wit of Oscar Wilde, period productions, or to anyone who is simply looking for an intelligent, entertaining and thoroughly satisfying comedy.  It's definitely not one to be missed!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.51}, {"id": "211479", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis Invicta men's watch is an outstanding time piece.

That seems especially important in Munich since the standard pils or helles can be served by the maas (a litre) a time. As I read this book, German beer is not as complex a subject as is craft ale in Belgium and the United Kingdom.  Stringent laws limit brewers to 'three ingredients' types of recipes, with some brews being lagered (aged)in either metal or wood.  Perhaps this is why there are no detailed 'tasting notes' to help us sort things out and to decide on which brew we might want to try. We find the familiar pilsners, helles, bocks,dubbelbocks and weissbiers (wheat-based ales). The largest brewers are covered in this guide.  Where are the 'independent' craft brewers?  The author does a fine job in orienting the reader/traveller to the Munich beer scene and his descriptions of each type of beer seem to be fine for that purpose.  A key point he makes for drinkers is that Munich/German styles of beer can vary widely in alcohol content and that this can have a major impact if you are drinking by the liter or 'having more than one.'\n\nHaving just reurned from a week in Munich, where I put this guide to good use, I can say that it  really 'shines' in helping travelers to find a 'bier garten'in whatever part of Munich you might visit. There are good maps with instructions about using specific routes and forms of public transportation.  These maps fall down in one particular way:  the map numbers do not always conform to the master keller listing for each area of the city so it is not easy to move from the master map to the individual maps provided for each keller. I learned a few specifics about beer hall etiquette and the section with lyrics from popular drinking songs illuminates that part of the culture. Many entries cover outlying places that would not interest tourists staying in the 'center' of the Old Town.  In the places I visited, a varied beer list was available and the standard serving size was a half liter or even quarter liter.  Lighter drinkers need not be put off by concerns that they 'have' to drink the big measure or none at all (as the guide may imply.)\n\nThe 'small' places in this guide are described as having a hall for 250 customers plus other rooms. This can be misleading. I visited Spaten, for example, and had dinner and beer in an upstairs dining room that was 'intimate' by that standard.  Travelers looking for more details about beer cuisine or local beer hall food specialties need to look elsewhere.  References to food service are buried in the detailed writing about the history of each keller or garten and pretty much stop at the level of 'has food stalls' or 'restaurant on the premises.'  Much of this background content strikes me as unnecessary since there is an emphasis on the 'this family owned it and then that family bought it' history rather than on illumninating stories about Munich. This writing takes up space that could better be given to expanded descriptions of 'atmosphere', clientele, decorations and music. Careful combing of entries yields the occasional 'serves some of the best food found in bier gartens' in Munich.  The Index does not provide a quick way to focus on kellers serving good food.  Since this book was last revised in 2006, it can't report on the 'current' scene.  With all the positive reviews it has been given, I hope that the author is already working on an updated and reorganized edition.  As it is, the book will still 'work' for anyone looking to sip a couple liters of local brew in a big community/tourist setting and it also works for those of us looking for a quieter drinking experience.\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

I bought this book to introduce me to the subject and to help me make informed choices of what to drink on a one-month trip to Belgium and the Netherlands.  I am at home now, and I can report that Webb's information made a good tour itinerary into a special life experience for me. I reserved for meals at some of the restaurants he most highly recommends and I visited equally fine pubs I would not have found without his guidance. The information he provides in each of his entries is so good that I think a range of drinkers and diners will be able to find some place or some beverage that is very close to their personal interest.\n\nThis book goes farther than ale:  it has the best short essay I have found (after a lot of looking) on Belgian food, places to stay and historic and cultural sights as well as the expected focus on beer tourism.  Beers/ales are rated on a one to five scale and flavors are described, there is a focus on independent brewers (the ones that spend more money on ingredients and take more time to \"get it right\") but mass-market brewers are not neglected.  Art work shows Belgium at its scenic best and focuses on each beer/ale served in its eye-catching special glass and stored in its colorfully labelled bottle.  All photography is high quality, as is Tim Webb's writing.\n\nI am not a beer fanatic but I am a fan of CAMRA, their philosophy of what makes \"real ale\" and of their guide books.  Last year's month in England  was much-improved by their guide to British real ale and the pubs that serve it.  I found great food, great drink and great architecture with its help.  Belgium presents beer differently than does England:  the emphasis here is not on pub culture and pubs.  The brewers and their products are front and center in this book and web addresses are included so one can find each brewery's take on its own products and one can find US importers, should one want to order some exceptional brews.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n\n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.16}, {"id": "211483", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThe story must have been written for a 2 year old.

The only minor quibble I have is that since the cover is clear it reflects light differently when compared to Sylvania 26941 - CF13EL/MICRO-MINI Compact Fluorescent Light Bulb. I hope and wish that LED Bulb manufacturers like TCP makes bulbs with frosted white cover to diffuse the light better.\n\nBottom-line: I am rating this product with Four stars!

NO! - In my case it has been quite a challenge! Here is why... Firstly the bathroom fixture in my house uses 'candelabra E12' Base. OK not a big deal as you do have various candelabra base bulbs available . But, secondly (Most importantly) the globe Light bulbs needs to be very small to fit properly inside that bathroom light fixture.. That's the real issue I was facing.\n\nWhen the original Decorative Globe Light Bulbs (40W regular incandescent bulbs) burnt out I did some minor modifications to the light fixture so that it can take a Micro-mini CFL so that I can cut on the energy costs and at that time (about 10 years ago) the only company who offered those small size CFLs were&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sylvania-26941-CF13EL-MICRO-827-C-BL-2PK-Twist-Candelabra-Screw-Base-Compact-Fluorescent-Light-Bulb/dp/B00FZR2DKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sylvania 26941 - CF13EL/MICRO/827/C/BL/2PK Twist Candelabra Screw Base Compact Fluorescent Light Bulb</a>\n\nGranted those CFLs did their job in cutting the energy costs down but they kept on burning out every year or so and I got tired of buying them again and again. I was searching high and low for more reliable LED replacement for the light fixture and I am pleased to say that finally after several weeks of searching I finally found the perfect replacement Decorative Globe Light Bulbs for the Bathroom Light fixture.\n\nSo how does this&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Triangle-Bulbs-5-watt-LED-Light-Bulb-E12-Base/dp/B00PQL7FA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Triangle Bulbs 5-watt LED Light Bulb E12 Base</a>&nbsp;stack up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sylvania-26941-CF13EL-MICRO-MINI-Compact-Fluorescent-Light-Bulb/dp/B00FZR2DKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sylvania 26941 - CF13EL/MICRO-MINI Compact Fluorescent Light Bulb</a>&nbsp;?? - See for yourself.

His brother takes over and seems completely incapable of making a good choice. The series of events lead to a great story with many unforeseen twists.\n\nThe general premise of the story has been done many times over.

The key to making this work is how the author gets you from the beginning to the end.\n\nMatthew Warren Wilson does a good job of telling the story.

Following an exceptionally tragic event as a young child, Michael Turcotte has had a very difficult life.  When he has a horrific vision, he tries to get Sams help to prevent the violence that he is convinced will come.\n\nJason Parent really knows how to kick a story off in high gear.  He introduces us to Michael as a small child, setting the stage for the young man that he will become.  When we next meet Michael, he is in one of the most terrifying places on earth, a high school, boys bathroom.  The events that follow bring to the forefront some real life events that no one should ever have to face.\n\nMichael has a gift, which is also a curse.  As a reader, I felt his frustration and anguish; Michael is what I want in a hero, a tortured soul who just wants to do what is right, and he must overcome his own weaknesses to accomplish his goal.\n\nThe dynamic between Michael and Sam is very well done.  These two individuals have been brought together under very dark circumstances, but they bring some light to each others life.  Sam brings security and stability to Michaels life, and Michael gives Sam a reason to continue to battle her own demons.\n\nSeeing Evil is a great story that will keep the reader flipping pages until the end.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 1.22}, {"id": "211486", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis handmade flower leaf vintage cuff is very pretty and youthful.

Slowly Lev starts to learn the secrets of his family and realize that some of the family secrets are more terrifying than ghosts.\n\nYelchin won a Newbery Honor for Breaking Stalins Nose. Here he very successfully merges historical Russia with a dark ghost story. Based on the premise of having found old notes and drawings from Lvov, the book is immediately mysterious and filled with wonder. There is the amazing setting of the huge mansion, filled with things like death masks and a basement of mothballed clothes. There are the servants who manage to work for his aunt despite her disdain and harshness. There is the ghost, who tells his own story but ever so slowly. They all create a world of darkness and beguilement.\n\nThen the book turns and changes, becoming something deeper and more filled with emotion.

Charles is worried by the state of the building, knowing immediately that it must be haunted. When Charles tries to sleep in his bedroom for the first time, he discovers he is right and there is something in his closet. Luckily, a neighbor gives him a card for Margo Maloo, Monster Mediator. Charles considers himself a journalist and wants to interview Margo, but she is having none of it though she lets him join her in negotiating with the troll who lives in the basement. Charles finds himself in a parallel world to his own, where there are trolls, goblins, ogres and many more monsters than he could ever have dreamed.\n\nWeings graphic novel tosses readers into a new world that is strongly based in our own. With Margo as an expert guide, this book is much less about battling monsters. It is more about how monsters can get along and live alongside humans in a urban setting. Weing has created a complete monster society and ensures with his stories that the monsters are not the bad guys, just easily misunderstood. The writing is clever, the dialogue solid and the pacing is fast.\n\nThe art of the graphic novel is modern and filled with plenty of action. The city and characters are filled with diversity that includes humans and monsters in different skin tones. Weing uses the real estate of his panels in smart ways, lengthening them to share more scenic detail, focusing the scope closely when necessary and broadening them for large buildings.\n\nJust the right book for Halloween, expect this and future books to be popular thanks to a wise mix of humor and shivers.

I waited to review this new Take 6 release, only after having several listens. And unlike one previous reviewer, I'm far from getting bored with it. Quite frankly, owning most every album they've released since 1988 I consider this comparable to most anything else they've done. Their vocals and arrangements haven't skipped a beat. This release also marks the farewell of longtime band member Dr. Cedric Dent (baritone), and the arrival of Khristian Dentley.

What A Friend We Have In Jesus: This classic hymn is given new life, and for me personally this is where the CD rolls over into a whole new level of Joy. The listening experience takes another turn as the beat starts to move you from here...into track #5. See if you can keep from bobbing your head up-and-down; Reverently of course--\n\n5. In My Heart: --Feel the beat? Smooth transition wasn't it? You wouldn't even know the songs were changing until you started to hear the familiar words of this next track. Can hardly sit still can you? This is Take 6 at their very best!\n\n6. Noah: Story telling--or should I say preaching at its finest? If you liked 'David' from their 1988 platinum certified 'Take 6' you'll really love this one. uptempo, astounding vocals. It then takes on a Brazilian sort of vibe that is out-of-this world. Ever wonder why they are the most Grammy nominated vocal group ever? Just listen to track #6. And we're not just talking gospel; that includes all genres.\n\n7. Allelula: Who but Take 6 would even attempt this standard without a full mega choir host of sopranos, altos, tenors, baritones, and bass behind them? I'm talking Mormon Tabernacle calibre!. I even had the experience of tackling it as a tenor in our high school chorale of some 75+, under the direction of Don Fontana. Former director of Robert H. Schuller's Garden Grove Community Church/Crystal Cathedral(Hour of Power)Choir from 1974-1981. I still hear and remember some of those high tenor parts near the end. Outstanding.\n\n8. Glorious Day: This gospel standard is given its due in the very capable hands of Take 6. Powerful vocal solos are a standout on this energized recording. Have you ever heard the gossip that \"Take 6 don't really sing with the Spirit?\" \"They can't really get down with true gospel?\" Just take a listen, then get back to me once you stop \"Havin' church\" brothers and sistas.\n\n9. You're Gonna Need Him: Southern Gospel Done Well!!!\n\n10. Farther Along: Southern Gospel Done Well!!!\n\n11. Noah Reprise: in case you didn't get enough of that Brazilian thing going on... Love those raindrops!\n\nAnd just a heads-up; this is not really an acapella effort. Most tracks do include either drumbeats, tambourine, guitar; and in the case of 'Can't Imagine Love Without You' Stevie Wonder's beautiful harmonica playing. Noah and Allelula being the only true acapella offerings. But with music this good, who cares?!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

And amazingly, in a very short span of time. As a child of the 50s & 60s, \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\" will always stay in my heart. This was a huge part of my childhood Christmas tradition year after year.\n\nI couldn't quite give this recording any higher rating than four stars though, due to the reproductive quality of the old mono sound. But I would still recommend it for the most part. Probably not the program I grew up on, since this is the original from the very early 50s; I was born in 1955. But the power of this story and the superb music written as an opera, probably the best ever composed for television, will delight anyone familiar with this work. And I'm sure many others will be won over as new listeners.\n\nThere are said to be many local stage productions of this classic annually, but I've only had the pleasure of seeing it once live on stage, and that was the early 70s, put on by my high school drama and music departments. There was even a newer production shot in Israel in the late 70s, but I didn't enjoy that much higher budgeted effort anywhere near as much as the earlier version I remember, or this recording from the original cast done back in 1952. The newer version just didn't have the same emotion or magic. So much for location scenery.\n\nAt this time, I await with great anticipation, the black-and-white DVD offered here on Amazon that I recently ordered. They also offer the newer 70s version, but I wasn't interested. Be forewarned though, the very dramatic ending will bring many to tears, especially from \"All That Gold\" to \"Oh, Woman, You Can Keep The Gold.\" A television classic.\nScore:"}], "output": "4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 2.13}, {"id": "211499", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Here are a couple of review-rating pairs of a user.\n<EXAMPLES>\n\nReview:\nThis review is for the audible version.

It makes me want to live life more fully and purposefully - and believe I can. Anyone considering being a pastor would do well to hear his wisdom, too.\n\nIt is a keeper that I go back to visit from time to time when I want the reassuring wisdom of a grandpa who has lived life well, creatively, lovingly and is still in the game after several careers.

When read slowly and thoughtfully, with time to sit back and mull over the sometimes bewildering and often-quoted but seldom understood quotations from the book of Ecclesiastes and Gibsons illuminating comments, this book is very rewarding. There are questions for further reflection, too, which I used and appreciated. What a marvel to understand these concepts at my oldish age; I wonder if I would have believed and grasped them when very young... Gibson writes so well. I cant begin to distill the wisdom conveyed as he has done a great job of making every chapter count.
