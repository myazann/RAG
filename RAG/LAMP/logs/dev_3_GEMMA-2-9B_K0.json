I'm a sucker for sports related romances, so I had gotten hooked on Roz Lee's baseball series.  (Check her out here: [...] ) Her fourth in the series just came out a few days ago & I picked it up last night.  H.O.T. !!!  OMG!  So the title is \"Bases Loaded (Mustangs Baseball)\", and apparently it refers to a \"secret club\" that these FICTIONAL major league ballplayers have created, where there is a sexual challenge put forth to women who are invited to participate -- and the result for those who make it through all (4) bases is some jewelry pierced into some... um... personal spots.\n\nAnyway - this is the story of Antonio & Clare - Antonio is new to the Dallas Mustangs baseball club and Clare is a college music professor who moonlights as the baseball team's organist.  He catches sight of her at a fundraiser and realizes then & there that she is his soul-mate.  However, she is \"curvy\" and has massive self-esteem issues, so when he hits on her, she thinks he's being a bully & trying to humiliate her.  The resulting story is how he works through what he thinks are perverted needs for the woman who will bear his children, and she works through her body issues, as they fall in love.  Since it is the off-season, he has lots of free time in which to \"woo\" Clare.  The ultimate problem?  She wants to \"run the bases\" for his \"Bases Loaded\" sex club; he feels too possessive and they have constant clashes over this.  If you want to find out how it all shakes out... READ THE STORY!!!  (Disclaimer:  toy play, anal, m/m/m/f, light bondage.)\n\nOkay, so I'm always a vocalist about digital book pricing, so I will say that this is very well priced for the amount of pages it has - WELL worth the money!!!  This isn't SOLELY sexually based; beyond the character growth of Clare learning to like herself as she is and to realize her inner AND outer beauty, there is a female bully (& don't we ALL know some absolute BITCH who just LIVES to make others feel like crap??!!!??) who threatens public humiliation of Clare and Antonio, which would result in the loss of his contract.  Lots of angst... lots of sex... lots of self-realization that beauty isn't all about Barbie dimensions!\n\nGo read it.  It's awesome.  Just make sure the Partner or BOB is nearby - you may need their \"assistance\".

No part of it escapes\n\nThe author starts with testing.  In short, negative trials (the kind that say a new treatment did not work) disappear more often than they don't.  This is horrible on a number of levels: 1. It's like rolling the dice a thousand times but only discussing the five hundred best outcomes.  The result won't be representative.  2. People who participate in trials and risk their health to do so deserve better.  3. People who might participate in a similar trial in the future really really deserve better.\n\nBen Goldacre was not the first to think that this is a problem, and manifold \"cures\" have been sought/recommended to the problem: medical journals have committed to only publish papers if they can prove they did not \"gag\" negative results; patients could be warned ahead of participation that the results of the experiment conducted on them might be gagged (though this avenue has not been pursued); professional bodies and regulators have committed to the dissemination of data. The author proves that in practice none of the promises are being kept.  He gives names and addresses.  If he was wrong about the slightest fact he'd be in jail now.  The bottom line is that the pharmaceutical companies carry on with this practice because \"he who pays the piper calls the tune\" but also because the regulators are both \"captured\" and highly secretive by nature.  He leaves out a further reason I once read about in another book called \"Reasonable Rx,\" namely that pharmaceutical companies would not under any circumstances want to prevent their competition from going down the same blind alley they just did.  But of course, given how combative the author is and given how many times he points the finger at specific companies he cannot include this criticism, since it is an unprovable allegation.\n\nFrom the \"gagging of negative results\" problem he then moves on to the horror of the \"Stage 1,\" \"Stage 2\" and \"Stage 3\" trials that bring a molecule from its discovery to the point where regulatory approval (FDA approval in the US) is first sought.  Stage 1 is the business of trying a new drug on people who get paid something like twice the minimum wage to subject themselves to the new molecule.  At this stage the point is merely to find if the drug is harmful, not to see if it cures anything.  The book describes these awful communities of people for whom this can be their sole profession, who more often than not have no medical cover if something goes wrong and who sign their life away before participating, though this is still an improvement on the previous prevalent practice of conducting these tests in jails.  Famous criminal Whitey Bulger was exposed to LSD this way, I seem to recall...\n\nThe next two stages are about finding out about how the body absorbs the drug, if it does what it's meant to do with sensible dosage, and of course if it is effective.  Oh, and increasingly many of these trials now take place in super-poor countries around the world, among populations that not only should never be our guinea pigs, but might actually differ significantly in how they absorb drugs.  My wife's from Japan and I'll tell you her body absorbs alcohol very differently than mine does.  CROs (Clinical Research Organizations) are described in some detail too.  These are the companies that conduct the trials.  Once upon a time it was universities, but these days it's private companies, who are in the business of selling the results to the pharmaceutical industry.  No bonus points for guessing what their incentives are.\n\nThe laundry list of dirty tricks used in trials by these industry-dependent CROs is breathtaking.  Outright fraud aside (which happens a lot) the tools of the trade include 1. testing on ideal, super-healthy patients, rather than real-world patients who will be often carrying other ailments 2. benchmarking against wrong dosage in the alternative treatment 3. benchmarking against invasive procedures such as surgery over too short a period of time, which will always favour the drug 4. carrying on with catastrophic trials in case they turn 5. trials that are merely large enough to prove something is better than placebo masquerading as trials that are big enough to prove a drug is better than another existing drug, 6. again, typically small trials that are not truly trialling anything and are just marketing ploys to get doctors to prescribe a drug,  7. bundling of outcomes in a way that highlights improvements in the extreme rather than the average 8. scratching from the outcome what happened to patients who dropped out of the trial (when in reality this behaviour can be a good predictor of patients subsequently dropping a drug) if that makes the result look better 9. fishing in the data of failed trials to find out if the drug worked on a (by definition, not statistically big enough) subgroup and, most insidiously, 10. changing your mind ex-post on what you were looking to cure.  Every trick comes with an example from real life.  This is a veritable catalogue of largely legal but ethically highly objectionable behaviour, and if you are remotely human you will be enraged to read about it.  And if one small detail was wrong, Ben Goldacre would be serving hard time.\n\nRegulators also come under the microscope and they don't scrub up too good either.  Quite often, the burden of proof they impose on new drugs is that they must merely beat a placebo rather than the currently \"best in class\" drug.  Head-to-head tests are as rare as hen's teeth.  Mankind today actually has no idea what the best statin is, for example; no pharmaceutical company has an incentive to run one and no regulator has ever done the work to find out, a fact that statistically speaking has led to millions of premature deaths.  That is not to say there's no room for multiple drugs.  There is, since the statistically most effective drug may have side effects that don't work for all patients.  Regardless, you would have thought there's a duty to establish what the most effective drug is.  It's clearly not how the regulators see it.  Not only that, but regulators allow most new drugs to come to market after proving they can improve a \"surrogate outcome\" like the cholesterol count, rather than the outcomes that matter like smaller likelihood of heart attack, for example.  In many situations that's the best we can do, of course, but there are circumstances and illnesses where the burden of proof should be much higher.  We also find out about the abusive practices of the industry, which drives drugs through the \"accelerated approval\" loophole that was carved out for very specific situations.  Again, all of these arguments are made with concrete examples of drugs.  The discussion in this book is NEVER theoretical, it's always via example.  Names and addresses.  And the accusation against the regulators can be summed up as follows: on every issue they are happy with relentless drift toward the lowest common denominator: placebo vs. head-to-head, surrogate outcomes vs. real outcomes and accelerated approval for drugs where we really ought to wait.\n\nThe least surprising but longest and most salacious part of the book is to do with marketing.  The author goes quickly over the horrors of direct advertising of drugs to consumers, the websites and fake surveys that invite us to click on to discover if we're suffering, for example, from anxiety etc. etc. and lists tons of studies that prove direct marketing is financially effective and fundamentally wrong, but saves himself for two biggies: the armies of sales reps who have woven themselves into the fabric of the medical industry and the fabrication of company sponsored \"research.\"  The sales reps bit is easy to understand.  It's a bit how bond brokers take me out to dinner, and I love it.  Though of course I would never dream of dealing with them more next morning , needless to say.  It's just the other guys who do that.  My mom believes me, even if you don't.  The research bit is chilling.  Bottom line, pharmaceutical companies plant most research in periodicals.  They employ armies of authors to write the stuff ahead of the launch of new drugs (first a barrage of articles about some new ailment that affects tons of people, then a barrage of articles about promising new medicines) and then literally hire academics to put their name on the ghostwritten research.  This is more insidious than it sounds, because academics benefit doubly from having their name attached to research.  If you only ever sign stuff you wrote you are in unfair competition for promotion, recognition etc. with other doctors who are happy to sign stuff that was ghostwritten for them by a pharmaceutical company.  You obviously miss out on the money too, but that's the lesser of your problems.  Journals turn a blind eye to this, because all the ads they carry are for drugs, of course.  There's nobody watching out here.  Again, Ben Goldacre lists names and addresses, none of this stuff has come off the top of his head.\n\nBottom line, marketing is 25% of the costs of a pharmaceutical company, research is half of that and the rest is to do with actually making and distributing the drugs!  The author complains that marketing not only is unethical; it also adds a 33% to the price of medicine!\n\nThe book closes with a long list of proposals;  summarising solutions the author has been proposing to the specific problems in every chapter.  For example, the NHS has the means to tarck true-world outcomes (not surrogate outcomes) on true-world (non-ideal, superhealthy) patients and has a moral duty to do so, though obviously it needs to overcome the issue of personal data.\n\nHe even suggests we start with a South-African style general amnesty, subsequent to which we need to go back and find all the missing studies, find out what data we can collect from existing sources and figure out what tests we urgently need to run.\n\nAnd since it's the second edition I read, the proposals are followed by a long afterword that lists progress on the proposals which actually sounds quite heartening.\n\nThat said, it's INCENTIVES people respond to, and this Ben Goldacre does not address.  The world of pharmaceuticals and medicine needs its incentives to be restructured, or else it's difficult to see how we don't drift back to where we started, and all this after the miscreants have bagged the amnesty!\n\nI must say that after reading this book I can see where the authors of \"Reasonable Rx\" were coming from when they recommended that the industry be split in two, namely companies that only develop drugs and companies that only market them.  But I still hate their recommendation that a government-supported agency should stand in the middle.  It's not easy, that's for sure.\n\nAnd now I know a tiny bit more about what was on my friend Elias' mind that day in Notting Hill...\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 2.22}, {"id": "2122", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

James Garner stars as a kidnapped American officer who, while recovering in a military hospital, is led to believe that he is suffering from amnesia.  The key to his recovery is to recall the details of the Allied invasion France.  The twist is that Nazi's actually have him captive and have set up an elaborate charade to convince Garner that the war has been over for years in hopes of discovering the Normandy invasion plans.\n\nRod Taylor plays the part of a German doctor masquarading as an American doctor attempting to coax memories from Garner.  Taylor's character is very sympathetic to Garner's plight and half heartedly attempts to draw the information from him.  Although Taylor's character is that of a German playing the part of an American, it is difficult to see him as anything but an American.  This is even more suprising as Taylor was Australian.\n\nEva Marie Saint plays Garner's attending nurse who is torn between assisting Garner and keeping herself out of a concentration camp.\n\nWerner Peters reprises his oft-played role as a Nazi officer. You have seen him play virtually the same role in THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, and THE SECRET WAR OF HARRY FRIGG.  In 36 HOURS he is bent on rushing the carefully scipted amnesia scenario and cracking Garner in order to discover the D-Day invasion plans.  In doing so he shows his true colors as a self serving and glory seeking individual.  He explains this to the German doctor when he blatantly admits that any failure will be blamed on the doctor whereas success will lauded on Peters.\n\nActor John Banner also makes a pre-Hogan's Heroes appearance in this film. Even though Banner wears a home guard uniform and patrols a fence other than that of Stalag 13, Banner is still lovable Sergeant Schultz.\n\nThe plot of this movie has been compared to the elaborate schemes hatched in episodes of Mission Impossible.  In fact, 36 HOURS was remade as a television movie by Ted Turner as BREAKING POINT in the late 1980s.\n\nThere was some location shooting in Portugal and additional second unit exterior filming in Germany.  However the bulk of 36 HOURS was filmed in California with exterior shots in nearby Yosemite Park.  Take note of the German army uniforms with the oversized insignia and shiny stahlhelm helmets.  These uniforms were straight out of the MGM wardrobe.  Television series such as COMBAT! also made use of these one-size-fits-all uniforms.\n\nThis movie has been difficult to come by even when it was only available in VHS.  In fact prior to acquiring the DVD the last time I saw this movie was on late night television 30 years ago.  Despite reviews about some DVDs with diminished clarity, my copy was intact and absolutely clear.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "2133", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Combined with twists and turns at every corner, this romantic suspense by miss Howard will have you guessing until you reach the shocking conclusion!.......After returning home to the family ranch in Central Florida, a ranch she inherited along with a mountain of bills, Michelle Cabot was shocked to discover that her father borrowed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars from a man she not only despised, but secretly loved for more than a decade.  It was difficult to think of letting the ranch go, and she had almost begun to believe in hope once again that she'd be able to hold on to it, but in that moment, she realized she had failed just like everything else in her life. It was ironic after years of casting insults back and forth at each other, she would now need John Rafferty's good will in order to survive financially to save her cattle ranch, making Michelle realize that she hated him, feared him, and loved him rolled all into one  for a man she knew she could never have , and she knew with a certainty he was nothing but a hell raiser, but mostly, a heartbreaker that could destroy her if she ever gave him a second glance.  Known for having a notorious reputation when it came down to women, rancher John Rafferty was a 6 ' 3\" 200 pounds of muscled masculinity, and he was thrilled the little \"Ice princess \" was begging for his help regarding the money he loaned her father against her ranch, and he had the perfect idea how Michelle could pay back the money she owed him in the most carnal ways, a hunger he felt for years for the one woman he desperately wanted for ten long years, but after he discovered her secrets and the hell she's been through for more than a decade,his first thought was to protect the only woman he ever loved!..........\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "2138", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I described that first entry in the series as an intense, engaging, grandly imagined, intelligent, entertainingly well-paced and veryverysexy story; erotic romance writ large. I also noted that \"Cover Him With Darkness\" ...ends with a cliffhanger worthy of \"Lord of the Rings\", and leaves us breathless for more Its a pleasure, then, to report that \"In Bonds of the Earth\" is everything fans have been waiting for, taking all the elements that made the first book memorable, artfully supercharging them in a sweeping, action-packed, powerfully erotic story that dazzles with its imaginative employment of real-life settings, elements of ancient lore and legend, and fast-paced contemporary thrillers.\n\nThe story is told in first person from the viewpoint of Milja, somewhat wiser now after having freed fallen angel Azazel from eons of bondage, she is doubtful about her lovers plan to release his brothers from their prisons in order to mount a new assault on the forces of heaven. His search leads them to the labyrinth of ancient monolithic rock-cut churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia, where the priests, wielding the rusted relics of saints, guard a secret that humankind must never know. (No spoilers here, but lets just say that the mid-story climaxand Ashbless way of relating itis exciting as all get out!)\n\nThe romantic leads are realistically imperfect here; Milja is smart and beautiful, but also still rather nave, not always wise in the ways of humanor angelicbehavior, and still vulnerable where the heartnot to mention her hair-trigger erotic responsesare concerned. She describes Azazel, for all his physical allure, as not very bright, a musclebound creature who lives in the here and now without much thought for consequence or the feelings of others, least of all Miljas.\n\nI wasas everimpressed by Ashbless ability to set her tale within a broad historical and cultural context without resorting to obvious data dumps or dry narrative digressions; the fascinating history of Lalibela is woven so subtly into the fabric of the story as to seem perfectly of a piece with the unfolding adventure. The authors erudition shines through, illuminating the story without ever casting shade on the reader. Miljas informal conversational style does not clash with her obvious intelligence, but brings readers comfortably along, never making them feel patronized or inadequate.\n\nThis entry in the series closes with a shattering cliffhanger that will have readers on the edge of their seats, hearts pounding in their throats, and practically howling in half-fulfilled frustration! I felt afterwards as if Id enjoyed an extraordinary meal, richly fed to be sure, yet craving still more, able only to dream of next time.\n\nWell worth the waitand lets hope the wait for the third book won't be too long!\"In Bonds of the Earth\" is enthusiastically recommended!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "2157", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Hopefully a good number of you readers recognize the name Michael Crichton, and are familiar with his body of work, as it is rather extensive and his untimely passing in 2008 came as a massive shock and resulted in extensive news coverage. For some of those who are taking the first step toward this man's creations, welcome! Come prepared for a journey into a scientific mind, intelligence and articulate with narrative. Bring you into the world known as the Congo. it seems only appropriate that I share a quote from the late, famed explorer, Henry Morton Stanley. \"The more experience and insight I obtain into human nature, the more convinced do I become that the greater portion of a man is purely animal.\"\n\nThe Congo... a dark territory filled with the unorthodox, many things foreign to civilized man, boasts promises of potential rewards. It also awaits our focal group, who are about to embark on an extremely hazardous trip. After receiving a horrifying video-taped distress call from a team of explorers, a new group are sent on a rescue/discovery mission to find out precisely what's happened. Once in the Congo, we begin to discover just how dire this situation was and unfortunately still is. Examining footage of the missing team's desperate pleas for aid reveals what appears to be some type of creature of devastating strength. But this second expedition have more than a single goal in mind, the missing are just one bit of this trek.\n\nWe find ourselves involved with quite a variation of characters, each harboring different motivations. On this exploration we have Peter Elliot, a zoologist who has brought along Amy. Amy being a bright young gorilla that communicates with humans through American sign language. Her purpose is to help understand some of things that have been seen on the tape and to let her experience what her natural habitat is like, give her a taste of liberation. Along with a crew of African helpers, we meet their superior, Munro. Munro's an expedition leader with a questionable character, but uncanny talents that often prove quite valuable during their treacherous trip. Then there's Ross, a woman working for the government with an agenda she has no intentions of sharing. Not to be ignored are the pigmy tribe,who are actually of help to the travelers. Prepare for a consortium of foreigners fighting for power and trying to beat Ross to the same mysterious thing she searches for. For the most part, these are the key players to deal with in Congo. However, there are two other elements to this list that must be remembered since they make for the novel's true horror. First, The Kigani Tribe, a cannibalistic group always on the search for victims and second, the unknown protagonist seen on film. These creatures appear as though they leapt straight from a nightmare; as Amy would say \"like a gorilla but not a gorilla...a bad thing.\" You've met our crew: it's up to you whether or not you'd like to invest the time in getting to know these personalities, their mishaps...horrors ...and deaths.\n\nGet a look at Amy - who plays a rather pivotal role in this story - onscreen, in the 1995 film directed by Frank Marshall.\n\ncongo+1995\n\nNot long after beginning to read this novel, memories of viewing the movie years ago swarmed the mind. I definitely recommend the original format over Frank Marshall's cinematic adaptation. This is a science based horror story that injects some exaggeration, but maintains a lot of fact as well. It most definitely contains terror and horror, but Crichton plays classy and keeps the gore a distant, underlying element of the tale, rather than an in-your-face piece of the puzzle that cannot be ignored. So, I suggest if you choose to read this book, you do so knowing that you're in store for far more of a biological thriller than a blood and guts creature trope.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm choosing to hold back just a tad on the rating of this book, but there's a personal reason for that, and I'll explain: I give Congo a 3.5 rating, but my rating would no doubt be higher if not for the fact that sometimes Mr. Crichton incorporates a bit more technology in his novels than I care to know about. In this day and age however, that will more than likely be embraced by a good many readers, since it's obviously a technology fueled society we occupy today.\n\nWritten by Vitina Molgaard from Horror Novel Reviews.

I was excited for another Leigh Bardugo book, but after the ending of Siege and Storm I had doubts on the direction this book would lead me. So I wasn't all that hyped going into it as I had been for Siege and Storm, but that didn't deter me from the plot and the twists and turns that Leigh Bardugo throws at her readers. The story was complex and at times it was heart-wrenching. While I didn't agree with the ending entirely, it was warm and cozy and just plain enjoyable.\n\nThe book picks up shortly after the end of Siege and Storm with maybe a few days/months having past. Alina's recovering in the midst of the Apparat and his nearly completely delusional zealots who worship as if she's a god. Alina has no interest in being their worshiping figure, but wants to give them freedom from not only the Darkling but anyone who wants the power he possess. Which is one thing that keeps coming back to me over and over with Alina; she tends to react for the greater good before thinking about herself. It occurs more often than anything in this book, which is more heroic and saint-like than what she thinks.\n\nAlina and Mal are on the hunt for the phoenix to complete Morozova's color, and while she they are searching for it, the Darkling is on their tail nearly at every turn. The Darkling has declared nearly all out war on anyone affiliated with Alina and Nikolai. I find that there wasn't enough Darkling in this book. He wasn't a villain more of an evil guy that just happens to show up at random times. Yea there are some visions and insights into him, but there it just never added up to gain an attachment or fear him at all.\n\nNow Nikolai was a figure that while being the sassy attractive figure that everyone grew to love in Siege and Storm. However in Ruin and Rising he just falls sort of his normal attachment. I rarely found that he was trying to win Alina over like previous and was more of that creepy guy hanging out in the bushes. But further when he gets involved with the Darkling the outcome just leaves him a shell of who he was. For a good part of the book he was the light, the comic relief of the book and by removing that the book just got dark and depressing. It needed Nikolai, and far far more of his light heartedness.\n\nGetting on with Mal, there was just not enough of him to really comment on that anyone who read the first book wouldn't already know. The character growth for Mal was what he was in the beginning, being the sword that will fight for Alina. While that is at times costly, it just keeps Mal locked into one roll that cannot and will not change. I find Mal likable and would have preferred to see what he could have done if he didn't need to find that phoenix for Alina. It was just so tragic to see a preferred love interest just get locked into one spot and not allowed to deviate.\n\nThe world in this book is generally the same. The beginning of the novel is rather lackluster tunnel system, that is more confusing than anything else. I wanted more out of this, some sort of way to tell what is going on inside the tunnels. Outside and in the normal world which is the rest of the book, it was all similar to the previous parts of the series. Ruin and Rising just rinsed and repeated what's already been done. There was a new outpost with Nikolai and the little journey to find the Phoenix. But at the same time, so much of the book was reused and rehashed, that it just stole from what hope was there.\n\nI would say that this book was an easy book to rate and deserves the rating it got. However, when I started writing this review and even in my notes I have it done for a solid 4.0 rating. The reason it got lowered is after typing up some of the notes and the comments I had on the characters and how the world just wasn't there. I found that the title lives up to the plot. The first two were decent to great, but this just seemed to fall where Siege and Storm left off. Its sad to say, I am not sure what could have been done to make this book better other than to just start over. It just fell flat.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.71}, {"id": "2172", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Now, he has to figure out how to save the woman who is his enemy so they can figure out together how they can save his life.\n\nIll be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. While I really fell in love with a lot of the characters so far in the Darkest London series, it had been a while since I read the last one. And these two characters were introduced in the last book Shadowdance. So I went back and read the last few chapters of Shadowdance to re-familiarize myself with their story and characters. Im glad I did because I think this added to my overall enjoyment of Evernight.\n\nI really like Holly Evernight. Shes brilliant inventor and social recluse. I genuinely enjoyed her. Her dry sense of humor and stubborness is endearing. She reminds me of a friend I have, actually, who is slightly socially awkward. Shes a lot of fun to read, especially in most of her scenes with Thorne, who loves to push her buttons and get a rise out of her. Thorne is a classic boy hero. He would pull her pigtails if she had them. He pushes her on, needles her with his wit and charm. Its a sweet romance with two very well developed characters.\n\nThe story is interesting with a lot of layers and multi player motivations. It kept me guessing till the very end. That said, I am slightly disappointed by the way it all turned out. I mean, of course I want the HEA, but it felt rushed towards the end and then BOOM. Suddenly, all these things that had been plaguing the characters from the beginning all turned out to be fine with not a real solid solution. Shrug. I don't know. Im being picky.\n\nSome familiar characters pop up again in this latest installment, but we don't really get a lot of whats going on outside of Holly and Thorne. I would love to get a little more continuation on favorite characters like Miranda and Archer etc.\n\nI cant wait to read the next one because it sounds like it will be about Eliza May and Adam. Wow. That sounds super intriguing.\n\nOverall, Evernight is a fun story filled with magic, romance and the best parts of Darkest London.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "2178", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

There are a couple side mysteries not cleared up, but they are left in such a fashion as to actually improve the story.\n\nThe book is a naked argument against capital punishment, so if that bothers you, stay away.  I remain strongly pro-death penalty, but its preachiness didn't bother me; I think we should all keep in mind the inherent human weaknesses in the system.  We have a legal system, not a justice system, and we cant un-execute a convict.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "2190", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

For all that I know, I would say my odds of doing this would be quite high with all the youth camps, revivals, and countless relationships that needed mending. \"God, I'll give up anything you ask me as long as you let this one person hate me less,\" would often be my words. If we are being honest with our heart, we know that it happens all the time.\n\nI have made a concentrated effort to start reading books written by women. I have nothing against women authors, it is the simple feeling that I could relate to men better. While that is a true statement, I took a chance and could not be happier. The words of Anything by Jennie Allen wrecked my world. It seemed as if she was speaking directly into the situation that I had found myself in for a specific season of life.\n\nI had told God that I would gladly give up anything for him to use me, but what happened when he took those things away? What happened when things in my life were removed by force? Could I still cling to the word \"anything\" when we were ecstatic with news of a baby only to suffer a miscarriage? Were my words true even when I lost my job? Could it be that I really didn't mean anything, but rather I wanted to bargain to God for an anything but scenario?\n\nHear me out before we get too much farther, I don't believe God took the baby from Leighann and I but rather things happen as a result of this fallen world we live in and there is nothing we could do to change that. The job, on the other hand, could have been God answering a prayer. I had prayed for God to provide a way out of the company I worked for and He provided, just not in the way I wanted. There are things we will never know this side of Heaven and even there some questions will be left unanswered. I try not to think about those things.\n\nJennie tells her story of how she came to say yes to anything. She also goes on to recount the times that God has asked her family to say yes to giving something up for his glory and the struggle of continuing to do this. Like Jennie, I would not say that it has always been easy process, but the payoff has been spectacular. Through the encouragement and challenge she provides, I have learned to give things up when God asks rather than holding on to them. I have learned that what we need will be provided in due time.\n\nIf you have not read this book, please do. The impact it will have on your life will be one that will last decades.\n\nAs a side note, I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review. The words contained in this review are my own and have not been manipulated by the publisher in any way.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21100", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Rip can be read as a stand alone, however it is a spinoff from the Eagle Elite Series. RVD does an excellent job of recapping events, so a new reader to the series would not feel left out or confused in any manner. It's a ideal opportunity for those wanting to dive into the series. Anytime I can see my mafia guys, I am thrilled.\n\nSometimes the most terrifying things you will ever encounter are also the most beautiful.\n\nThe first chapter is intense to say the least and sets the tone for the entire book. It is enthralling from the beginning moments until the last chapter. There are subtle clues throughout, but RVD does an impressive job with leaving you wondering what is truly transpiring. I had at least two or three theories going at anytime and was constantly changing what I thought after each chapter. Nikolai is intriguing and it took the majority of the book to fully understand and appreciate his character. He is definitely a mystery and unlike most of RVD's usual main characters. Maya was fascinating as well, and I found her to be likable. Her father and his darkness seemed to only make her stronger. Nik and Maya's chemistry was intense, but more of a slow burn. I loved the angst between them as all the clues fell into place about their relationship.\n\n\"The scars you can't prove are usually the ones that hurt the most.\"\n\nWhile this book has darker elements for RVD, this by no means a \"dark read\". The most powerful element is definitely the suspense. You have to be patient and let the story slowly unfold. It's also a perfect book to reread or skim back over, so you can pick up all the clues that were left behind or missed the first read through. Of course, it was exciting to see my favorites from Eagle Elite. They are true to their usual style of humor and toughness. I recommend this one to any suspense/romance lover and a must read for any Eagle Elite fan.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "21101", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Her friend, her mother, and later her famous boss, have too much power over her, which is not a traditional gender submissiveness because the person with power also is a woman, and the narrator is uncomfortable with her malleability. Her lack of growth through much of the book is frustrating. Race also matters to the story as both the narrator and her friend are half black and half white, growing up in London housing projects.

Well, a month later, I find myself listening to this more than any other CD I own. Glassjaw have (somehow) managed to strike a chord in my own personality. They have their finger on the pulse of what my life is like today. I haven't been able to relate to and get so much out of a band in so long. I have been listening to it just about 3 times a day, and it still sends shivers down my spine. The emotion in Daryl's lyrics and his singing voice are the perfect combination. The sound produced on here is really refreshing, in a year where everyone was trying to be as heavy as possible. Undoubtedly the best debut of the past few years. \"Pretty Lush\" is the best track on here, with the infamous line \"I wish you a broken heart, and a Happy New Year.\" The whole CD is just laced with lines like that. \"Hurting and Shoving\" is another standout, the heaviest, no doubt, and another song that just fills that kind of musical gap that has been left wide open for the last few years as far as new bands go. \"Majour\" is just nothing but heaven--even from the opening lines to the end. A lot like the Deftones, Glassjaw use violent imagery while painting a beautiful picture, which in my mind, Daryl excutes just as well. Maybe it's his voice, a Tom Yorke/Chino Moreno/Elvis Costello hybrid, I don't know. But the honest truth is, you would be denying yourself one of the best musical experiences of your life if you did not get this CD. It has touched me in so many ways that I can't even explain.

With the house to himself, he makes a checklist of fun activities and uses the girl's other toys as companions. Later, that same evening, Roddy awakes to a strange noise and arrives in the kitchen just in time to see Sid (Shane Richie), a fat sewer rat, explode through the kitchen plumbing. When Sid realizes where he is, he quickly makes himself comfortable. Roddy is aghast at the messy intruder and comes up with a way to get rid of him. Offering his guest a Jacuzzi bath, he shows him the toilet. Sid is all for the Jacuzzi, but turns the tables on Roddy who is soon flushed away. In the sewers, the pet rat finds a miniature London populated by sewer rats, frogs and slugs. He soon meets Rita (Kate Winslet), the tough as nails skipper of a little schooner. She is wanted by the Toad (Sir Ian McKellan), the local gangster with  a brood of rat henchmen, including Whitey (Bill Nighy), a former laboratory rat who is now an albino and Spike (Andy Serkis, the Gollum in \"The Lord of the Rings\"), Whitey's none too bright accomplice. The Toad has a master plan and wants the ruby Rita stole from him. When they retrieve that, Rita quickly grabs the \"Master Cable\", the Toad's method of controlling the flood gate into their world. Rita and Roddy form an uneasy alliance to escape and set things right.\n\n\"Flushed Away\" is a CGI Animated film from the same people who brought us the \"Wallace and Gromit\" films and \"Shrek\". If you are familiar with Wallace and Gromit, you probably know they are animated using an old fashioned technique; Claymation. The figures are made out of clay and they are moved and changed for every single frame, giving them a rounded look and making them appear three dimensional. You also frequently see thumbprints and imperfections as the characters move and change, but this is part of the charm for this type of animation.\n\nIn \"Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-rabbit\", the filmmakers developed a new software program allowing them to animate the bunnies floating around in the Bun-Vac 6000, while retaining the same look of Claymation. This software was used to make all of \"Flushed Away\". Essentially, the entire film is created with CGI, but the software maintains certain imperfections and shows us an occasional thumbprint. It is an interesting idea and works well. Perhaps too well. I'm sure this new software allows for a faster production schedule, but it also allows the filmmakers to create larger, more complicated landscapes. This robs this type of animation of intimacy. In \"Curse of the Were-rabbit\", it was more than a little endearing to see Wallace and Gromit's little British village come to life. In \"Flushed Away\", Roddy enters a miniature London, complete with replicas of the London Bridge, Big Ben, Piccadilly, neon, ads, shops and more. It is just too large and makes the characters seem lost and more traditionally animated. This scene is reminiscent of the same company's \"Shark Tales\"; we watch Will Smith's character swim into an underwater version of Times Square.\n\nHonestly, when I saw the trailers for \"Flushed\" I thought Roddy was voiced by Ralph Fiennes. After his appearance in \"Curse of the Were-Rabbit\", it fit. So I was shocked to learn the voice was Hugh Jackman. He does a good job of playing a rich, upper-class rat, used to a life of privilege in the Royal Borough of Kensington. Kate Winslet does a good job as Rita, the skipper of her own boat, with a large family to look after, providing for her disabled dad (David Suchet) and mum (Kathy Burke) and their ever increasing brood. But their performances are just a little too ordinary. They don't add another dimension to these characters.\n\nThe real voice talent lies in the supporting cast of characters. Sir Ian McKellan seems to have a great time playing a larger than life Toad bent of controlling his little universe. He has some funny moments throughout the film; for instance when he shows off his prized collection of ceramic representations of the Royal Family, he smiles broadly like a child showing his report card, eager for a nod of approval. He is all bombast and ego as he tries to continue with his evil plan, making him a funny take off of many of the James Bond villains.\n\nJean Reno is also amusing as Le Frog, the leader of a band of French frogs who wear leather jackets and do the bidding of their cousin, the Toad. At one point, he yells for his followers to respond and they shout \"We surrender.\" Later, he is perturbed to have his coffee interrupted and throws a coin on his Parisian caf table before hopping off.\n\nBill Nighy is also very good as Whitey, the brain damaged henchman of the Toad. He states \"I used to be a laboratory rat. Dealt with a lot of shampoo and now I'm white.\" Throughout, he adds a certain goofy charm to the role.\n\nThe film contains a couple of ongoing funny jokes. When Roddy first arrives in the sewers, he encounters a large group of slugs, who are as terrified of the rat as the rat is of them. They scream a high pitched squeal and attempt to run away, but their progress is slow. Throughout the film, they return and provide a sort of Greek chorus, singing songs from the 50s and 60s, fitting for that particular moment in the film.\n\nPerhaps the funniest ongoing joke is the Mime Frog. The band of French motorcycle gang frogs have a mime who accompanies them everywhere. When they first appear, they stop for a moment, so he can do a little routine. Later, when they are confronting Rita and Roddy, Le Frog brings out a cell phone with a camera and the Mime places it in front of his face. While the Toad speaks to them from afar, the Mime acts out the Toad's gestures, pace, inflections and more. A couple of times the Toad gets exasperated with the Mime, yelling at him to do something. It is an original and funny sequence.\n\nThe character transformations for Roddy and Rita happen way too fast. One moment, they are fighting each other, pairing up simply because they have to. Then they are suddenly longing for each other's company and they want to spend the rest of their lives together. This is not a subtle change and brings to mind the type of character development one would find in an animated series on television. Why couldn't they find a few more moments, another story development to make this more believable? The problem is the kids won't even notice this type of thing. It is the adult chauffeur's who will and keeps the film from joining the hallowed ranks of animated classics.\n\nDuring the screening, I noticed one father snoring loudly throughout the entire film. Clearly, his interest was not held. And I can't believe he was the only one.\n\n\"Flushed Away\" is cute, bright, and full of energy but has story problems and the larger canvas robs the animation of any intimacy. Why try to recreate the look of Claymation in CGI if you are going to try to make the landscape huge? Claymation begs for intimacy. \"Flushed Away\" is a film sure to keep the kids happy and adults will have a few laughs. It is a good animated effort, not as good as some I have seen this year (\"Cars\", \"Monster House\", Open Season\", \"Over the Hedge\") and far better than others (\"Ant Bully\").\n\nGo to a bargain matinee.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 1.01}, {"id": "21115", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The way things are communicated are not the same ten years ago. Cultural trends come and go along with hairstyles.\n\nSome people say the church falls into that category as well. Think about it. What worked in the 1950's does not work in the 21st century. Gary L McIntosh in his book, Growing God's Church, talks about research that has been done over the last ten years on how people are coming to faith. McIntosh expresses that some churches have become missional with evangelism as a primary task. To be honest, I have never known a missional church that wasn't evangelistic but he does make a good point. Evangelism needs to be one of the top priorities of the church.\n\nThe gospel message brings us to believe in Christ or reject him, McIntosh expresses,and there no middle ground, which is true. In some churches we have messages where you can come to Christ without following him. If you read the Bible, you know believing in Christ means to follow Christ.\n\nMcIntosh continues to talk more on the research on how people came to faith in Christ, what led them to Christ, and what keeps them in the church. He even addresses the pastor's role in evangelism, which a pastor does have a role in reaching people for Christ but so does the entire church. He concludes the book on what steps a church need to take to be effective evangelists which some of them almost sound seeker-friendly but I know he is trying not to express that.\n\nIn short, Growing God's Church is a helpful book for those who want to see the church reaching the lost. I don't think it will make the top 10 church growth method books, but it is a decent book to read.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "21117", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Unlike the four previous volumes, published between 1953 and 1958, Tales of Ten Worlds consists - with one exception - only of pieces written no more than a few years earlier, namely when Clarke was in his forties and at the very beginning of his long prime. Of courses the collection is uneven, but any faults or limitations it might have are completely obscured by its considerable merits. The latter, in a nutshell, can be stated as follows: this is probably Arthur Clarke's most varied and richest collection; none of the pieces is dull or valueless; many of them are in fact genuine masterpieces. Where to start?\n\nWell, let me start with my absolute personal favourite: ''Death and the Senator''. Now, quite simply, this is one of the most perfect stories I have ever read: sounds trite but it happens to be true. Even on the most mundane level, the story is impeccable in terms of fine structure, narrative subtlety and sharp dialogue. The plot is perfectly conceived and executed with rare skill. Ironically enough, this is one of the stories that were ''spoiled'' for me by Arthur himself, for in one of his non-fiction works he gives away the plot completely. If anything, this only proves that when we're dealing with great literature such things like ''spoilers'' simply do not exist. It will be hardly difficult for anybody to guess the ending from the very title and, perhaps, the opening paragraph.\n\nWhat makes ''Death and the Senator'' a fabulously brilliant piece of writing is the character of Martin Steelman, drawn with such depth and shattering vividness that you find but seldom in a short story, and of course numerous hard questions about the meaning of life he comes to reflect upon just a little too late. All other characters are secondary, but none is any less alive or compelling for that. All those people who still rant about Clarke's ''flat characters'' should read this story very carefully indeed. To cut the long story short, ''Death and the Senator'' alone is enough to give this book five full stars. Not often do I find a piece of short-fiction so heart-rending and affecting and at the same time uplifting and even amusing. Here is an example that made me laugh:\n\n'''What's that?, cried Joey.\n'It's an elephant, stupid,' answered Susan with all the crushing superiority of her seven years.''\n\nAnd here is one that made me very sad:\n\n''It was a sad reflection on Martin Steelman, if so commonplace a fact as showing an interest in his own grandchildren could cause curiosity.''\n\nBut there is so much more in this book, and the variety is so overwhelming, that I again don't know how to continue. True, these stories may not bring you to ''ten worlds'', but you can personally visit at least eight: Earth, Moon, Venus, Mars, Saturn, a glorious comet, a hot asteroid and the open space.\n\nThere are few other stories, in addition to ''Death and the Senator'', in which science takes only a minor part, being used only as a supplement to plots concerned with social, political and personal issues that every great fiction is bound to deal with. Two immediate favourites are ''I Remember Babylon'' and ''Hate'', both of them nearly perfectly written stories with lots of food for reflection.\n\n''I Remember Babylon'' is a very weird story indeed. Here Clarke did beat Maugham himself for a piece of fiction most firmly rooted in reality. Not only does he use his own name several times, but he describes a glittering diplomatic party in Sri Lanka which was surely drawn from life; there is even one compelling reference to Maugham himself, as Arthur was ''surveying the scene in my detached or Somerset Maugham manner''. It is not at all easy to realise where the non-fiction ends and where the fiction starts. Yet the story smoothly turns into a marvellous dystopian vision of worldwide TV propaganda beyond censorship, in which Clarke's own, and pioneering, ideas about communication satellites play a prominent role. Whether the world in general and the States in particular have fallen, are falling or will fall down as Babylon did is a matter of fascinating speculation, but Clarke was probably not so wide of the mark when he wryly remarked in the notes to his Collected Stories that virtually everything in this story has come true. The only difference, of course, is that TV has been considerably helped by the World Wide Wait (sorry, Web, as Arthur once joked) in the process of global mind corruption. Nobody disputes the great benefits, or even some noble intentions that may have been there in the beginning, but this is a very scanty compensation for brainwashing on a vast scale.\n\n''Hate'' reflects another of Clarke's passions: diving and ocean exploration (more like exploitation in this case). The story takes place entirely in the ocean and on the board of a small boat, yet it is one of the most overtly political works in Arthur's oeuvre - who never shied away from dealing with politics in his fiction anyway, as obvious from ''I Remember Babylon'' and its ''minor political earthquakes''. The protagonist in ''Hate'' is a Hungarian who passionately hates the Russians, clearly a reference to the disturbing events from 1956, and what this fellow does when confronted with a Russian astronaut trapped, but still alive, at the bottom of the ocean you can imagine. Though predictable, the story has an excellent twist in the end which makes one contemplate with horror the prospect of being at Tibor's place. In addition to devastatingly perceptive description of love's antithesis, another strength of ''Hate'' lies in the vividly recreated life of the pearl hunters, where every mistake under water may well be your last, and particularly in the masterful description of the horrifying obsession that hate may easily turn to. Disturbing, provocative and not easily forgotten story that will bear a good deal of re-reading.\n\n(By the way, an interesting leitmotif in this collection is one of the most unfortunately natural states of the human beings: panic. In \"Hate\" you get an underwater example, and in \"Summertime on Icarus\" and \"Who's There?\" you get equally vivid examples in a space ship and in the open space, respectively.)\n\nRight on the other side of science fiction are stories like ''Summertime on Icarus'' and ''Before Eden'' which can be described, rather ineptly, as \"hard science fiction\", or ''gimmick stories'' as Arthur would snap, and which in lesser hands would be a tedious stuff to read. Not so here. ''Summertime on Icarus'' is perhaps the most suspenseful story in the volume, taking place, of all places indeed, on a small asteroid passing extremely close to the Sun. There Colin Sherrard crashed his ship and was about to be roasted alive by a merciless sunlight which has nothing to do with its feeble cousin that reaches the Earth. The story really should have been titled ''Dawn on Icarus'', but it is a superb piece of dramatic characterisation none the less for that. Colin's panic, accompanied with harrowing screaming, is reminiscent of ''Who's There?'' and ''Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting . . . '', two other tales of similar type but on a slighter and more humorous scale. As for ''Before Eden'', it transports us to the South Pole - of Venus, where the temperature is ''only a hundred degrees hotter than Death Valley in midsummer.'' Apart from the moral that we, humans, are very careless when we are handling any other kinds of life but our own, the story has a number of ravishing descriptions of the Venusian landscape. Some of these are as haunting and visionary as anything on paper:\n\n''Jerry was still mulling this over when they came upon the lake. Even that first glimpse, it made him think not of the life they were seeking, but of death. Like a black mirror, it lay amid a fold in the hills; its far edge was hidden in the eternal mist, and ghostly columns of vapour swirled and danced upon its surface. All it needed, Jerry told himself, was Charron's ferry waiting to take them to the other side - or the Swan of Tuonela swimming majestically back and forth as it guarded the entrance to the Underworld...''\n\n(Here is another piece of evidence that Arthur did love Sibelius - the composer I mean, not the computer program. While writing the above he must have been hearing in his head the beautiful tone pone The Swan of Tuonela, with that wistful English horn that's just about to break your heart...)\n\nStories like ''Saturn Rising'' and ''Dog Star'' occupy the no-man's-land between pure science fiction and normal (scienceless?) fiction. Both combine adroitly poignant and amusing moments. ''Saturn Rising'' looks forward into the distant future when we shall, perhaps, have luxurious hotels on Saturn's satellites, with Observation Lounges from which to contemplate the rising of Saturn. That must be a sight all right, but the story goes much deeper than that, exploring our eternal struggle between success and happiness. ''Dog Star'' is the story you should not read in case you are a dog lover - or get yourself some tissues for it is likely to make you cry; I can't say that I am a dog lover myself, but it certainly made me. The protagonist of the story is one of those unfortunate creatures who communicates much better with animals than with human beings - a type most easy to identify with, I'm afraid - but has to choose between his job and his dog. As it turned out, the choice was harder for Laika than he expected. The ending could hardly have been more heartbreaking. After dismissing, gently but firmly, any mystery about the psychic relationship between him and his dog, the narrator finishes thus:\n\nOf that I am sure, if I am sure of anything. Yet sometimes I wake now, in the silence of the Moon, and wish that the dream could have lasted a few seconds longer - so that I could have looked just once into those luminous brown eyes, brimming with an unselfish, undemanding love I have found nowhere else on this or any other world.\n\nLast but not least, to dispel the gloom a little bit, there is the group of deliberately - please note that word: deliberately - flippant stories, usually shorter and consistently tongue-in-cheek, and altogether a great fun to read. ''Let There Be Light'' was a most pleasant surprise because of the unexpected appearance of Harry Purvis, the learned crackpot who used to be the center of entertainment in the legendary (but only semi-fictitious) pub ''White Hart''. Apparently this story - a delightful variation of the perfect crime theme - came a little too late to be included in Tales from the White Hart (1958). \"Trouble with Time\" is another mini crime thriller, set on Mars and concerned with shady deals with antiques, and ''An Ape About the House'' is a vastly amusing tale about a gene-modified Pan sapiens, the future equivalent of housemaid, that suddenly reveals a considerable talent for painting. But my greatest favourite in this category definitely is ''A Slight Case of Sunstroke''.\n\nTruth to tell, while reading ''A Slight Case of Sunstroke'' I nearly died - of laughter. When Clarke feels like it, he really can be dangerously hilarious. The strange thing is that the story mostly deals, of all things, with South American football passions. To call the piece satire would probably be an overstatement, yet the ''pretty open game'' with no more than three fights and the referee with ''distinctly laboured'' movements because of the bulletproof vest he is wearing are not so far removed from reality as they should be on any civilized planet. However, the story does have a fine scientific premise of which a stunning use is made towards the end. All I can say about it is that the title is a monumental understatement. In between Clarke pokes lots of fun at the South American politics, diplomacy and customs, one more corrupt than the other (including the narrator), reaching an absolutely stunning climax when he comes to the football mores in the hypothetical countries Perivia and Panagura. So be careful with this short story. It causes tremendous convulsions which do take some time to die out.\n\nThe rather prosaically titled ''The Road to the Sea'' is the maverick here. It is the only short story written considerably earlier than the rest and, running to more than fifty pages (one fourth of the whole book!), it is rather like a novella - ''horrid word'' as Arthur once snapped. Before going into detail, having a mild passion for gorgeous covers, I want to point out that this golden and terrific, though stylised, Sphinx that adorns the Pan edition refers exactly to the last piece in the collection. Why it had to wait more than ten years to be collected in book form is beyond me. For I stand corrected: this is the supreme masterpiece here, and for it alone five full stars are not enough. It is so rich in content that I am a little surprised that Arthur didn't regard it as a ''compressed novel'', badly in need of decompression, as did he with ''The Songs of Distant Earth'', ''The Deep Range'', ''Against the Fall of the Night'' (which became ''The City and the Stars'') and ''The Hammer of God'', to name but a few.\n\n''The Road to the Sea'' is one of those fabulous pieces of fiction which tax my imagination to the utmost. Arthur does that kind of fiction disturbingly well. Here he sends you no fewer than five thousand (!) years ahead, in a time when mankind has conquered the stars and learnt many, though not all, of its numerous secrets. On mother Earth only a small fraction has remained, scattered in small villages after the mighty cities had been abandoned, reverting to ancient rituals and unabashedly hedonistic lifestyle - or to stupendous mental and physical sloth. These are ideas Arthur has explored many times in his speculative non-fiction: if the former still lies into the far future, the latter is already knocking on the door.\n\nAs has often been noted by the author, there is nothing wrong with uninhibited pleasure as long as it is not the only way. Following the coming of age and the romantic inspirations of Brant, necessarily in a condensed form, raises yet again the shattering dilemma of achievements versus reveries. How should we live our lives: lost in futile but intoxicating day-dreaming or dissipating all our energies in the exploration of the unknown. Sounds commonplace but the truth, as almost always, is somewhere in the middle. Exactly where nobody really knows, but works like ''The Road to the Sea'' might just give you a solid base for reflection on this conundrum. There's no better way to finish, I think, than quoting few not altogether forgettable lines of wisdom from this literary tour de force:\n\n''The person one loves never really exists, but is a projection focused through the lens of the mind onto whatever screen it fits with least distortion.''\n\n''No one had ever told her, and she had not yet discovered, that when one has to ask 'Am I really in love?', the answer is always 'No'.''\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.86}, {"id": "21133", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Kari knows where you've been and relates like a girlfriend.\n\nB) The quizzes and discussion questions. The little quizzes throughout the book reminded me of the quizzes I always liked to read in teen magazines when I was younger. I thought they were the perfect addition to a book for teen girls. The discussion questions at the end of each chapter are straightforward and real. Kari knows exactly what to ask and provides questions you really have to think about.\n\nC) The design. The totally cute design really hooked me before I even knew what this book was about. I loved the colors and flowers. I also like that this book is thin, so it's not intimidating for girls who may not be readers. 10 Ultimate Truths Girls Should Know is the perfect gift book. I highly recommend it for girls ages 12-16.\n\nDisclosure:\n\nI received a copy of 10 Ultimate Truths Girls Should Know from Tommy Nelson Mommy. All views and opinions are solely and completely my own. I was not asked to write a positive review. I received no compensation other than a print copy of the book featured in this post, which is mine to keep or gift as I so choose.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21135", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The emotional resonances among the characters are also much deeper in this volume, particularly in such aspects as the relationship between Sam and Frodo.  The two main reasons, though, for this readers' joy are the Ents and Gollum.  The ents are the most dazzling creation by the author of Middle Earth and Treebeard should live as one of the most memorable fantasy figures of all time.  And as for Gollum, I was pleased to discover how much I liked his prescence.  I found him a little trying in The Hobbit but here he works so very well.

Their real competition is against scanning apps like Smile Software's PDFpen Scan +, my current favorite scanning app which promises to \"turn your iPad into a flatbed scanner.\"  That is an overstatement by the app-maker because what it really does is apply optical character recognition to pdfs created from the camera of iPad or iPhone. However for may situations that is enough and the need for a foot long one pound scanner is not clear.\n\nThe age of iPad has many lawyers shucking their trial bags and hard copy files in favor of showing up at deposition or for a hearing with just an iPad. Taking along an additional piece of equipment to, say copy exhibits offered by an opposing party, almost always requires some sort of bag to lug things in. This scanner weighs as much as my iPad Air, so right off the bat, it doubles the mass required to go to deposition. Add a small nylon laptop case and that's even more to carry.\n\nAs to the scanner itself, it isn't really a substitute for the much heavier but much more feature laden scanners like the six pound&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-iX500-Scanner-for-PC-and-Mac-PA03656-B005/dp/B00ATZ9QMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Scanner for PC and Mac (PA03656-B005)</a>&nbsp;Scanner. That scanner, which has an automatic document feeder, duplex scanner (two sides of a document copied at once), and simply astonishing speed. It also has an app allowing the scanner to operate from an iPad app and save directly to iPad. Were I to know ahead of time that I would need to copy hundreds of pages of exhibits, I would not hesitate to bring the larger scanner particularly if I knew I could get it and iPad on the same wireless network.\n\nAs to the scanner itself. the scanned images are excellent, and it has a reasonable rated speed of 8 ppm for black and white and color  images. However it does not duplex and the documents have to be hand fed. You cannot use it like a flatbed scanner for obvious reasons.  The resulting pdfs still need to be run through an OCR app, something the PDFpen Scan + can do. It supports wireless transfer via a free app  but I gave up on that, preferring to scan to the 4GB SD card that come with the scanner. The interface itself is poor.\n\nSo at the end of the day, this is a nice scanner but it is a product whose inherent limitations should cause you to consider carefully how much actual use it will receive.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "21141", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Thus, hearing John \"The Penguin\" Bingham discuss his struggles with getting off the couch and taking his first steps on the pavement, made me smile.\n\nThe Accidental Athlete is a very short, quick, easy read (would have been a great on-going magazine article) that many will find inspiring. John humorously chronicles how he went from being on the fast track to an early grave, to trying to settle on a sport in which he could do well, to completing dozens of marathons and other races across the country, painfully detailing every struggle with which most runners will identify. While John never became a supreme runner (instead enjoying being in the back of the pack), his drive to better himself has made him a champion.\n\nFor the athlete -- or wannabe athlete -- in all of us, do yourself a favor and give this one a read.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "21142", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

God, it was just so beautiful in both spirit and prose. I seriously want every person I know to read these two books. It's hard for me to explain what makes this series so wonderful to me and the only thing I can come up with is these books have the most beautiful SOUL. The story is honest, believable, fluid. The ups and downs are heart affirming and heart wrenching and the characters are real, beautiful, flawed and perfect all at the same time.\n\nRhyson is one of my favorite male characters of all time. He is gorgeous both inside and out, talented, smart, funny and completely head over heals for Kia. He is also flawed, damaged and desperate to hold on to the love of his life. Watching him come to terms with his actions and their consequences and seeing him work for forgiveness and redemption is simply a breathtaking journey. Kia is an amazing female lead. Her strength and determination is inspiring, her heartbreak and insecurities are humanizing and her love for Rhys is a thing of beauty, but watching her figure out how to not lose herself in the Rhyson's shadow is what makes her character so much more captivating than I'm used to reading. These two characters are so multi-faceted, so complete, so extraordinary and yet so completely down to earth, that you can't help but feel every emotion they feel.\n\nKennedy Ryan is simply an amazing writer. She understand intrinsically how people interact, love, fight, play and connect. Every emotion, every reaction and every consequence was real and believable. There were times I wanted to scream at these characters, times I wanted to comfort them, times my heart broke for them and times I rejoiced for them. Every emotion was present and accounted for and Kennedy pulled them out of me even when I didn't want her to. I always feel some kind of emotion when I finish a series, sometimes happiness, sometimes sorrow because it's over, sometimes frustration because I did like the way something was handled. When I finished this series I felt like rejoicing, like my heart was full, sated, and joyous right down to my soul.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21145", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Digitalis is all action and it's so fast-paced your head will spin, and did I mention the sparks? The characters have so much fire and passion for God, country, and family in this book that the pages fairly crackle.\n\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any better than a guy on a fast bike, a man in a pickup comes along and steals my heart. If you're not half in love with Colton \"Cowboy\" Neeley by the end of this book, I will be very worried for you. Movie star good looks, a heart of gold and dedication to family all topped off with a Stetson...characters don't get any better. *Sigh* Piper Blum is an interesting heroine to say the least, I'm not sure if she's my favorite of the two we've met so far (a little helpless for someone who was in the military) but I still like her.\n\nThe supporting characters are incredible too. The Nightshade team is a true band of brothers, each different but so alike. With their back and forth teasing banter there's some great comic relief. The Neeley family and Colton's young daughter Mickey really make this story too with their show of love and care for both Colton and Piper. There were so many reason why I enjoyed this story that I can't mention them or this post would be 5 pages long!\n\nRonie Kendig has earned the top spot as my favorite suspense author.

I had my first exposure with Ed Wood on films such as \"Bride of the Monster\" and \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", but never did I see his earliest film until now.  This is definitely his most personal work, as well as his most bizarre.\n\nThe movie deals with the complications of accepting one's odd behavior among a prejudice society, the odd behavior being one's desire to wear women's clothing.  Bela Lugosi narrated in an unorthodox fashion, making vague and unrelated comments that mostly don't make any sense (but he sounded cool saying them) as well as being the initiator of one's desires.  Within the story, it introduced a counselor who thinks this is an educational video, because he sure enunciated all of the basic details about homosexuals, transvestites, and the differences between them.  He discussed with a detective about the tragedy of one cross-dresser, and then he introduced the central character, Glen (or Glenda).  Glen's about to get marriage, but he didn't tell his fianc about his other self.  He feared that his pleasure in wearing dresses might compromise their relationship, but he can't hide it forever.  Thus, it became a challenge for Glen to reveal his idiosyncratic behavior.\n\nThe movie was simple enough in fleshing out Glen and his inner trials...up until the movie reached the 40-minute mark.  And then for the next 10 minutes, \"Glen or Glenda\" went totally crazy with all the suggestive and confusing imagery.  It's a good thing I had some experience with feature-length&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/metaphorical/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">metaphorical</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/nightmares/dp/B0000AK80C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">nightmares</a>, so I got the handle on metaphors enough to make a personal interpretation on what this screwy sequence entailed.  The attractive yet hefty woman dancing around reflects Glen exposing his wild self.  The same woman committing BDSM on a random woman reflects Glen having full control of his particular self, as well as proving he has just as much strength in his femininity as any woman.  The narrator (Lugosi) watched these scenes in a straight face, perceiving everything that Glen tried to hide.  The 'Big Green Dragon' that the narrator mentioned is only a name, not a description, for the satanic being who's haunting Glen; technically, he has red skin, but that name only reflects simple irony in association with Glen's gender-bender desires. The civilians were pointing fingers at him with great shame, leading to what he thought was a metempsychosis, but the Dragon tricked him and the 'judges' continued to point their fingers, bringing Glen to face his inhibitions. Finally, as for the puppy dog tails and the snails...I guess Ed Wood was hungry.\n\nI have to say, that was a pretty clever sequence.  Either that, or I haven't a clue as to what went on; sometimes, I can't tell what Ed Wood's really thinking.  But when it comes to the technical aspects of the film, he's an easy read.  This is patented Ed Wood material: the stages and sets are notably cheap (love the notecard glued on top of a real newspaper heading), it's poorly edited, the actors are stiff and has lousy delivery, and there's a lot of obvious padding during transitions.  Simply put, this movie is really, REALLY atrociously made.  No surprise here from the publicly-viewed worst filmmaker of the golden age of cinema.\n\nIf one were to judge only by the production values of the film, then yes, \"Glen or Glenda\" is awful.  But once I look away all the technical atrocities and focusing on the core of the film, I kinda have to admire it.  Ed Wood had ambition, and he showed it in this film.  He didn't show it well, and just to nitpick, the film could've been more complete had it removed the subplot with the hermaphrodite named Allen, but the film is definitely bold and unique.  That is more than I can say about the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/cop-out-sequels/dp/B0006D3HEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">cop-out sequels</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/cheap-knock-offs/dp/B0039UT3M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">cheap knock-offs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/soulless-products/dp/B002U1LGTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">soulless products</a>&nbsp;after it, and with that, I approve Ed Wood for making an effort  Or at least tried.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.88}, {"id": "21195", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Michael Hopf's The End, the first of a series following Gordon Van Zandt and his family as they try to survive following an electromagnetic pulse (\"EMP\") which has wiped out all modern electronics. Think the Tom Cruise version of The War of the Worlds, only with terrorists instead of aliens. As is typically the case in such stories, Gordon's background (here, in the military) has conveniently given him a skill set making him better suited than most to prepare for, and respond to, the dangers of such a world.\n\nGenerally speaking, I have no complaint with this set-up; a post-apocalyptic novel in which the main character had no survival skills would be very short and probably uninteresting. However, Hopf's version is irritating for the opposite reason - it's far too long for a single book, much less a series of at least four. Hopf's author notes indicate that he is a Marine Corps combat veteran who \"has studied the threat of EMP for 6 years\" and has written his series \"to illustrate the effects\" of such an attack on the United States, and it shows. The End reads far more like a survival preparedness guide than a piece of fiction. That would be fine if the book were marketed as such, but for a reader who thinks she has picked up a novel, Hopf's writing is pedantic and repetitive.\n\nWorse yet, his view of those who are not as well prepared as he is for an EMP attack is unnecessarily insulting. I was particularly taken aback by his portrayal of Mindy, the president of the homeowners' association in Gordon's neighborhood, who rejects all of Gordon's advice because she wants to retain her \"power.\" From the minute Hopf introduces Mindy, she is a caricature of the \"HOA Nazi\" many of us laugh about; here she is, speaking to her husband just after Gordon has arrived at her house to give her his explanation for the power failure:\n\n\"Gerald, please take a seat. I'll just quickly tell you that Gordon has stopped by to give us his opinion on what he thinks is going on with this blackout[.]\"\n\nI do not believe that anyone would speak to their spouse in such a fashion in their own home. Hopf's disdain for Mindy and the other neighbors who do not immediately fall into line behind Gordon is unrelieved by any compassion or psychological insight. The result is that Gordon himself becomes a caricature of the overly disciplined, autocratic Sergeant.\n\nI previously mentioned that Hopf's writing is repetitive.

I admit that I have not served personally, but I know enough Navy personnel to find it hard to believe that a Gunny would say, \"We're a big family here too and we must take care of our Marines when they have a legitimate issue or concern,\" or that, after a battle, one Marine would say to another, \"Let me process what happened today and then maybe we can talk about it, but please respect me and stop asking.\"\n\nI could quote many more examples of Hopf's poor writing, but instead I will just conclude by expressing my regret at having agreed to review the second book in the series, The Long Road, before I read The End.

The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden are beautiful novels that still move readers, decades after their publication. Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat are whimsical, yet poignant tales from a bygone era of my neighborhood.\n\nAs I re-read The Red Pony and thought about todays middle schoolers, I found the story of Jody, the somewhat mischievous 10-year-old farm boy with stern parents, less than riveting. Granted, the themes of death and dying, maturing as a result of difficult experiences, of wanting to please parents and earn their love, are timeless and universal. Steinbeck wrote about them in a simple, yet profound way that continues to make this little book a classic at the middle school level. Nonetheless, I couldn't get past visions of the 31-year-old Steinbeck, not yet a fully formed novelist, scribbling away and honing his skills for the great works to come.\n\nDo I recommend it for middle schoolers? Definitely.

Residents can trace their lineage back to the Mayflower.  But as with every other place, Ashaunt changes over time, as do the residents.  Follow the changes to the land and the Porter family through death, birth, love, war, and the heartache that change inevitably brings.\n\nI really found myself struggling with this book.  The narrative is broken into four distinct time sections, yet within each section, the narrative switches between characters, and jumps forward in time.  It made for a very disjointed read overall.  The book follows one family, and most of the characters appear in multiple, if not all four, sections, yet I found it very difficult to connect to any character.  For example, Helen appears as a child in the first section, a young lady in the second, a middle aged mother in the third, and a dying senior citizen in the fourth.  Yet, I was unable to connect any one of these versions to the others, because I never actually got to know Helen as a character.  It is like when you meet someone as an adult, and see a photograph of them as a child; without knowing the person well, it is hard to see anything of the adult before you in the child in the photo.\n\nThe writing itself is quite lovely.  I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the natural landscape of Ashaunt.  New England is so particular, with specific social quirks and nuances, it was difficult for me to relate.  It was as if I had been given a private view into the life of a Kennedy-esque family, and struggle to understand their everyday lives.  Yet, despite the difference in social standing, at the heart of story were universal truths: love, life, death, illness.  No amount of social standing can allow a family to escape those realities.\n\nFans of contemporary fiction may connect to this book better than I seemed to be able to.

The story of David and Evelyn was great and I absolutely adored them but as always, what happens with me sometimes is I find myself more curious about a secondary character more. In this case it was the bands drummer Mal Ericson. He was hilarious and so much fun so I couldn't wait to get his story.\n\nDespite being about Mal, the book is told from the point of view of Anne Rollins. I wasn't expecting to get this from her POV but I loved Anne. Coming home from work she finds her roommate has left her high and dry having moved out leaving her with no way to pay the rent she was behind on. She's at the end of her wits in the face of the uncertainty and on the verge of breaking down when her friends next door invite her to a party. It's a happy coincidence that her neighbors are Lauren and Nate. Best friend and brother to Evelyn Ferris, wife of David Ferris who is one of the bands front men and host of the party. Against her better judgement she tags along hoping to take her mind off of everything. Once at the party Anne realizes she isn't comfortable rubbing elbows with the rich and famous. Stepping out onto the balcony to take a phone call is when she meets Mal.\n\nMalcolm Ericson is the kind of guy wet dreams are made of. Tall and lean with blond hair and incredibly down to earth He's known as the jokester to his friends and always the life of the party. Being a drummer myself it's not hard to see why I connected with him. I saw a lot of myself in his character traits. He's the kind of guy who hates to see anyone upset and does whatever he can to break the tension with a joke or acting a fool. One of the main traits I identified with is the way he uses humor to mask pain. Everyone in the band is worried about him as he deals with a family problem that threatens to drag him into a dark place emotionally. When he overhears Anne's current predicament he takes matters into his own hands and moves himself into her apartment. He approaches her with a proposition that if she will be his pretend girlfriend he will help her out financially by filling her old roommate's place.\n\nPlay was equal parts fun and serious. With Mal and Anne living together it was fun to see them interact. Anne always had a crush on Mal as a fan of the band growing up so having him in her space was so much fun seeing how badly he flustered her. The attraction between them was fantastic and with a no sex clause added to their agreement that lasted about as long as Mal's attention span, there was plenty of good times to be had. I couldn't have picked a better person for Mal to end up with than Anne. She's had a lot on her plate from a young age taking care of her younger sister Lizzy after her mom checked out mentally from a bad divorce. Failed suicide attempts, raising a child while still being one herself and struggling to make ends meet and put her sister through school turned Anne into a strong woman of immense character. You would think that her financial woes would have turned her into a gold digger with Mal in the picture but she remained independent of his wealth. That seems to be a theme with Scott's female characters because both Anne and Evelyn kept jobs despite how well off their men were.\n\nMal has such a big heart he was not shy about helping Anne however he could. It's almost impossible not to love a guy with such an amazing personality and giving spirit. Though he used jokes to divert attention from what was really going on with him the pain he was feeling couldn't be hidden for long. The circumstances behind his sadness were heartbreaking. With his mother battling an illness he sometimes had a tendency to lose himself in alcohol. This made Anne the perfect match for him after dealing with her own issues with her mom. Anne was such an great character. Instead of babying Mal she showed him tough love and stood her ground refusing to watch him go down that same road. Mal was used to getting what he wanted so it was nice to see her put up some resistance.\n\nAnne and Mal meshed so well together and their growing relationship brought a smile to my face several times throughout the story. It wasn't always easy for them though with jealousy plaguing them due to Mal's past flings, women throwing themselves at him constantly and Anne's current crush on her boss Reece there was no shortage of mild drama to keep things interesting. I got worried when they hit a bit of a rough patch and I don't know why why but I always expect Scott to throw in some cheating aspects during these times. Most guy characters at the first sign of trouble in their relationships always end up sleeping with someone else but I'm learning with Scott's guys that when they find the right girl there is no other for them. She did it with David in Lick and now with Mal in Play. I can't tell you how much that means to me as a reader. It shows amazing character growth especially for guys like Mal who can and DO get any woman they want. His devotion to Anne was not only impressive but sweetly romantic and silly as only Mal can be. I loved how in tune they were to each other.\n\nOne of the biggest treats was seeing all the characters I loved in Lick makes appearances in this book. David and Evelyn had such a great story and have an especially tender moment in this one that made my heart melt. I loved getting to see more of the other band members and seeing the basis of their stories take shape. The bands bass player Ben seemed to hit it off with Anne's sister Lizzy so naturally that pulled my attention to their possible story. Lead singer Jimmy also has something to say being fresh out of rehab and showing signs of interest in his new P.R. rep Lena.\n\nSometimes when you anticipate a book as much as I did with Play it can be a let down if it isn't what you hoped. This was NOT one of those cases with Play. It was everything I wanted and so much more. I got a healthy dose of my goofy and playful drummer Mal, but also a deeper understanding of what makes him unique. I expected him to find love but got another amazing and independent heroine full of moxie who kept him on his toes. I expected to see my favorite characters and got an in depth, heart warming look at their continued romance. Lick was a surprise hit for me so it wasn't all that surprising that I would love this one. Full of funny one liners, sexy romance and enough drama to keep you on the edge of your seat without wanting to take your toys and go home, Play was another winning hit in the Stage Dive series! If you haven't jumped on the \"Band Wagon\" (no pun intended) yet then I suggest you grab a copy and get LICK-ed today!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.97}, {"id": "21216", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

At just $19.99 per month, Packet8 is cheap, but the audio quality is poor and customer service is terrible.  If you want better quality, Vonage has much better sound quality and marginally better customer service for $29.99 per month.\n\n[...]\n\nREVIEW:  There are a number of companies that offer the ability to use your broadband internet connection to give you a telephone jack that you can plug your regular phone into.  This technology is known as Voice Over IP, or VOIP for short.  When you sign up, you get an adaptor you hook up to your internet connection and to a regular telephone.  When it works properly, you can pick-up your phone and make calls just like you normally might, but the call gets routed over the internet.\n\nA lot has been said about using VOIP as your primary phone line, but I'd sum it up this way:  Don't use VOIP as your primary phone line.  VOIP lines can go down for many reasons, including power failures, internet outages, or VOIP network problems.  But, if you want a feature-laden second-line, VOIP is the only way to go.\n\nThe technology is a fantastic idea and is loaded with great features, including the ability to get a telephone number in just about any area code, even if it is nowhere near where you live.  Most VOIP providers give you the ability to have more than one number (in different area codes if you want) ring to the same line.  They also provide caller ID, call-waiting, call-waiting caller ID, three way calling, call forwarding (including forwarding to multiple numbers at the same time), voicemail, and, some include the ability to transfer calls.  These features are usually free, along with unlimited local and long distance calling.  You can also take the adaptor with you when you travel and plug it into any internet connection (such as at a hotel) anywhere in the world, and use your phone to call anywhere in the U.S. for free.\n\nI've tried Packet8 (this one) as well as Vonage.\n\nBecause the quality of the audio is very important to me, I was very disappointed with Packet8's performance.  The voice quality sounds noticeably computerized.  I also use Vonage, which charges more per month, but has audio quality which matches a traditional telephone line.  Vonage also has the ability to reduce the sound quality if you want to reduce the bandwidth required, while Packet8 offers no option to increase the sound quality.\n\nI also found that Packet8's support was terrible.  I wanted to find out if the sound quality I was experiencing was the result of a defect or just a characteristic of the service.  So, I called Packet8's \"24-hour\" support line.  Although I placed my call at 1:30 a.m. and several times later in the morning and the following afternoon, I always reached an answering service who could do nothing other than take a message and promise a return call.  The return call never came.  In my view, a 24-hour answering service does not qualify as \"24-hour\" support, even if the calls had been returned.\n\nI also sent several e-mails complaining about the sound quality, and the only response that I got asked me to send another e-mail if I wanted support.  I did, but it was never returned.\n\nI finally called Packet8's main number and asked to speak to a manager.  The switchboard operator transferred me to a line that nobody answered.  When I called back, she transferred me to a voicemail.  When I called back again, she transferred me to a very rude person who insisted upon finding all of my e-mails before he would help me.  When I suggested that he help me first, and find the e-mails later, he hung up on me.\n\nI called again and the operator transferred me to the director of technical support's voicemail, where I left a message promising to cancel my service if I didn't get a return call.  Five minutes later, I got a call from a senior technical support representative who said that he was asked to call me by the director of technical support.  He called me on my regular phone line from a Packet8 line in their headquarters.  The call had the same mechanized quality that my Packet8 line had, which led me to conclude the audio problems are normal.\n\nAll that said, if you won't need support, and you don't mind the digitized sound quality of Packet8, you can't beat the price.  If you want better quality, Vonage (which you can buy at Amazon.com) offers better quality at a higher price.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.79}, {"id": "21222", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I know I read several of her books when I was a teen/tween, when I was looking for something a little darker than Nancy Drew.  Not sure if I'd read this one in the 80's, parts of it did seem familiar.\n\nI understand updating books to make them more modern and palpable to today's audience (especially when they're written for younger readers), but I wish they wouldn't do it!  This book was originally written in 1966 and it would still be entirely readable unchanged.  They've (Duncan?  The publisher?) put in references to cell phones and texting, but it doesn't fit in with the dialogue and seems forced.  A teenage polio survivor who has a cell phone?\n\nThe story centers around five teens who are kidnapped by a substitute bus driver:  Marianne (stepfather issues, comes from a broken home), Jesse (loner, military family), Dexter (angry, polio survivor), Bruce (in the shadow of his older brother, probably grows up to become a highly successful CEO), and Glenn (future frat bro and probable serial rapist).\n\nIt's a pretty short book and I enjoyed reading it, but I found the ending a little too abrupt.  But it revived my Lois Duncan interest and I think I'll seek out a few more of her books.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "21226", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

But I didn't expect it to be even more lacking than it was the last time. I was really looking forward to getting to know the Mindhunters boss, Adam Raiker, and watching him fall in love. But I ended the book feeling like I still didn't know him very well and that he never had much of a romance.\n\nThe suspense aspect of the book was really well done. It wasn't as fast paced and action filled as I personally prefer, but I imagine it reflects actual police work and crime solving more accurately. It was filled with procedure and small details that aren't exactly exciting, but are very necessary. Reports are filed nightly and the investigators' actions are always checked by what they are and are not given permission to do by the Assistant Director. Adam is able to get around this more often than Jaid and the other partner are, but even he has to be very careful about what he does, so as not to give the Assistant Director an excuse to kick him off the case.\n\nI thought I knew who the killer was quite a few times, but something else would always crop up to change my mind and make me guess someone else. I did guess who the killer was, but I had moved past that person and on to a new one, so I suppose it doesn't count. I liked the grisly nature of the case and trying to solve it alongside the characters, but at times I felt a little bored. But that was because of the focus on the procedural process instead of the action. I think if you're more of a fan of that than I am then you won't have the same problem.\n\nI was disappointed in the lack of romance in the last book, but I liked that the author showed us the characters' world outside of the case. I felt that those details were lacking in this book. We saw Jaid call her kid a few times and try to juggle babysitting, but those details felt hollow and lacking any real depth. I never felt I got to know Jaid or Adam very well, which is a shame because I would think that a man who could survive so many assassination attempts, and still get up every morning without fear, is a very fascinating man indeed. And this is a second-chance-romance where one side was very unwilling to break up. Where is the emotion? Where is tension? There was none, and I was a tad bitter over the lack.\n\nI was more forgiving of the lack of romance in the last book, Deadly Dreams, but since this one had even less than that, I feel I have the right to gripe. Why is this billed as a Romantic Suspense if no time is spent developing the characters or the romance? I've heard Romance referred to as an emotional voyeur's paradise, and I can't say I'd argue that description. I want to know this hero and heroine inside and out and feel invested in their relationship. I want to understand why they are behaving in certain ways without it having to be spelled out to me. I want development and tension and intensity. I just want a Romance, people! And I want all that while still having a banging suspense plot. It's why I picked up a book in the genre, after all.\n\nThe lack of character depth made me feel a bit like I was watching a movie instead of reading a book. I go into a movie knowing that I am not going to get any personal insight into a character--unless they're narrating it, of course. I know that the only depth I'll get is the kind that I am shown through their actions and other characters' comments about them. But that's okay, because I knew that going in. It's all about expectations. I expect more than that when I read a book. Especially when I don't have any vocal inflections or facial expressions to analyze, like I would in a movie. I just have these words that are supposed to suck me in and make me a part of the world. You can't just say:\n\n\"He hadn't made a move since that was less than circumspect. But there was a renewed awareness between them. A current that snapped and sparked to life at the oddest moments. She'd intercepted a couple odd looks from Shepherd lately, as if he, too, had picked up on it.\"\n\nand leave it at that. Why didn't you show me these glances? How come another character has picked up on it when I have seen nothing to indicate this? I need to be shown, not just told.\n\nI think that the author does a good job with the suspense aspect of the book and that the Suspense genre is really where the book belongs, not the Romantic Suspense one. I can't see myself picking up any more books by this author, though, because I look for more of a focus on the romance than Brant seems to prefer to write.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\n\"You didn't lose me, Adam.

One thing in watching this set makes you realize that even though the titles may not ring a bell, once you see these cartoons you know them and realize how much of them have been ingrained into your subconscious, as they appeared constantly on movie and television screens from the 1930s until about ten years ago thanks to those no good tutti-fruity Politically correct killjoys who push the likes of Barney and the Teletubbies down kids throats, but I digress.\n\nThe 1970s documentary BUGS BUNNY SUPERSTAR is quite interesting. Some good stuff with Bugs and co. mixed with interviews of the men who created them. Educational and interesting-these guys were as crazy as their creations. However, Bugs fans born between 1950 and 1980 will have warm hearts over the inclusion of the theme from the Bugs Bunny television show ON WITH THE SHOW in the extras.\n\nRegarding political incorrectness. As an African-American child, I was never bothered by Bugs dressing up as a Black person to outwit Yosemite Sam in SOUTHERN FRIED RABBIT, as Bugs didn't exactly wear minstrel makeup or the simian-like black caricatures all too common in cartoons of that time that I admittedly despised then as well as now. To say that Speedy Gonzales is embarrassing today is foolish! He almost always outwitted the \"gringo\" characters. But as for the wartime characterizations of the Japanese, I could see how that would casue some concern.\n\nBut enough of that for now.

Columbo, and Father Brown is one of them.  I loved this book of Father Brown cases.  Oddly enough, there is some interesting info on this fictitious character.\n\nFrom the equally amazing free Wikipedia:\n\nFather Brown is a short, stumpy Catholic priest, \"formerly of Cobhole in Essex, and now working in London,\" with shapeless clothes and a large umbrella, and uncanny insight into human evil.\n\nHe makes his first appearance in the famous story \"The Blue Cross\" and continues through the five volumes of short stories, often assisted by the reformed criminal Flambeau. Unlike the more famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown's methods tend to be intuitive rather than deductive. He explains his method in \"The Secret of Father Brown\":\n\nYou see, I had murdered them all myself.... I had planned out each of the crimes very carefully. I had thought out exactly how a thing like that could be done, and in what style or state of mind a man could really do it. And when I was quite sure that I felt exactly like the murderer myself, of course I knew who he was.\n\nFather Brown's abilities are also considerably shaped by his experience as a priest and confessor. In \"The Blue Cross\", when asked by Flambeau, who has been masquerading as a priest, how he knew of all sorts of criminal \"horrors,\" he responds: \"Has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men's real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil?\" He also states a reason why he knew Flambeau was not a priest: \"You attacked reason. It's bad theology.\" And indeed, the stories normally contain a rational explanation of who the murderer was and how Brown worked it out.\n\nDespite his devotion, or perhaps, because of it, Father Brown always emphasizes rationality: some stories, such as \"The Miracle of Moon Crescent\", \"The Blast of the Book\" and \"The Dagger With Wings\", poke fun at initially skeptical characters who become convinced of a supernatural explanation for some strange occurrence, while Father Brown easily sees the perfectly ordinary, natural explanation. In fact, he seems to represent an ideal of a devout, yet considerably educated and \"civilized\" clergyman. This can be traced to the influence of neo-scholastic thought on Chesterton.\n\nFather Brown is characteristically humble, and is usually rather quiet, but when he does talk, he almost always says something profound.

When operated and used the lock box worked as advertised and showed no issues.

Despite anxiety issues that plagued her life, Lily and her friend Kylie set off on what they thought would be a two-week vacation, but turn into an adventure beyond her wildest dreams.\nJared Claverack has lived in New Orleans from the time he was born.

I loved the hero, Jared, *insert big sigh here* He was totally dream worthy, I adored the plotline, Good and evil combine to make a great story, I hope to hear more about the lives of the two main characters and what happened when they returned home to her family, 5/5\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21251", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I put additional seed under it and raked the additional seed into the spots that were bare so I don't know if what is growing out there is the seed or the patchmaster.  But today, we have a lot of growth and you can barely see the patchmaster anymore.\n\nJust a really small amount of patchmaster over each spot kept the birds completely off my lawn and away from the seed.  Normally when we put seed down there are a hundred of them out there eating it.  Patchmaster kept the birds away completely. It also kept the seed more moist than watering alone.  I could go longer periods of time without watering because of it.\n\nI just want to say two things (1) it looks REALLY scary when you first put it down.  (2) I probably would not rely on the patch master alone for seed.

I was suspicious of him from the beginning so there was no surprise by the end. There is never a YA book where the third party wins in the contest. Personally I didn't think they needed a third party to creat tension- Daemon oozes tension.\n\nI thought this book the main character Katy was much more less assured of herself. I liked the stand-up to aliens girl she was in the first book, but here she has human to deal with and doesn't really do well. I'd rather have the strong, not need to depend on Daemon, girl back- even if she gets together with him. Daemon did not change and has remained a smart-ass. While we don't get to see as much of the relationship between Katy and Daemon- what we do see is as conflicting as ever. Daemon is trying to be nice, but obviously the boy doesn't know how to be nice. It makes for a lot of conflict but a good read.\n\nRecommendation: Yes, if you liked the first, you'll probably like this one- just be forewarned that Katy loses some spunk- but Daemon is there to pick up the slack.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "21259", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Nikki is just surviving, she's not living. She lost so much and its only with her job and the support of her best friend Cole that she is functioning.\n\nOf course we get to see the meddling Nadine who you love from afar but would be scared to get close to in case she meddles in your life as she's a force to be reckoned with! She forces Brant and Nikki to be back in each others lives, forcing them to face the pain of their past and acknowledge that they still share a deep love that will never go away.\n\nI really enjoyed the Wellington family reunion when they all arrive at the hotel to support Brant and Nikki.

I've never read a book set in Vermont and I've also never read a book about farmers for that matter! Especially a hot farmer with a specialty in making alcoholic cider. Bittersweet is funny, sexy and extremely heartwarming and I just couldn't get enough.\n\nAugust Griffin Shipley the third is the the grumpy, handsome farmer and Audrey Kidder is the hot little minx of a chef who has Griff all tied up in knots and completely frustrated. From the moment Audrey drove her car into the ditch on Griff's farm the chemistry was like BAM! Or maybe I should say the tension was that way, because this wasn't the first time these two have locked eyes. They hooked up in college a few times, but a misunderstanding about a phone call led them to never speak again, until now.\n\nAudrey is working for a restaurant company that needs to purchase products from local farmers in order to make their menus more enticing and rare, and Griff's farm--Shipley Farms is first on her list. I seriously think I have a thing for farms now! Everything about farm life from the pigs to the apple trees to the crazy farm hands and family members had me feeling all warm inside, I absolutely loved the feeling I got while reading this book. The author made slaughtering a pig sexy and romantic! How is that even possible? I have no clue but it was, and it was also strangely hot because of what it turned into, and maybe I need to get my head checked because I loved it!\n\nThere were so many cool little details in this story, I cried over an easy-bake oven and was grinning ear to ear with all of the Star Wars references I was pretty much in my happy place the whole time. I was left very hungry and thirsty though, like literally. With all the wonderful food being cooked and ciders being tasted you might want to have some snacks nearby because the author knows how to write about food and drink!\n\nThere's something about all of the camaraderie on the farm that really stuck with me, their sense of values and work ethic makes you fall in love with that type of lifestyle, and I just wanted to transplant myself into the beautiful landscape that the author created for the reader, because it felt very personal and I love when a book does that. I really loved each and every character and I kind of want to kidnap Griff's mom for myself. Book #2 is Jude's book, he's one of the farmhands and he's had a troubled past so I'm super excited to see what his book is all about, and hopefully I'll get a reunion with all of my beloved characters!

I made it one of my life's ambitions to see every one of the movies, and I watched Godzilla vs. Megalon so many times that the tape wore out and I had to get a new one. When the 1998 re-imagining from Roland Emmerich came out, my kid-self was quite entertained with it initially as an action film, but as the years rolled on I quickly came to realize that it was not a real Godzilla movie, and it did not stand the test of time at all.\n\nFortunately, the new reboot of Godzilla from Gareth Edwards is a proper Godzilla through and through. This is the return of the true Godzilla, who I spent a good sized chunk of my childhood obsessing over. There's been some criticism that this film supposedly did not have enough Godzilla in it, but my counterargument is that the film is paced just like the classic Toho films. In the old films, Godzilla usually showed up about half-way through, and most of the films would be shown from the perspective of human characters-- in a 90 minute Godzilla film, you'd typically only have a few minutes of Godzilla himself, but that is part of what made his character seem so much larger than life.\n\nI gotta say, seeing Godzilla in all his glory again for that first moment, and hearing the booming, updated version of his iconic roar brought a tear to my eye. Godzilla was one of my childhood heroes, and with the new visual effects making him look more real than ever, the experience was almost like seeing Superman or even Jesus in a movie for the first time. If for nothing else, I have to give this movie 5 stars for that.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21298", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Smart does a great job presenting the subject to various roles - business analysts, software developers, and testers among them.  He begins by grounding the reader in the concepts of behavior driven development as a cross-functional collaboration with goal of reaching a shared understanding of user story acceptance criteria.  He also makes clear transitions between the nuts and bolts chapters on tools and the collaboration/concept chapters.  I also thought that he did a good job covering a wide variety of tools including JBehave, Cucumber, and SpecFlow.  While it does add some volume to the text, I appreciated that he covered the specific tools that my company uses - JBehave and Selenium.\n\nHowever, this book is not just about acceptance or functional tests at a high level.  Smart brings these concepts and applies them to the unit test level as well by introducing Spock as a BDD-style unit testing tool.  This is important because it decouples the unit tests from the implementation.  He also gives an introduction to his companys open source tool - Thucydidies (which has been rebranded Serenity BDD).  This tool provides advanced reporting capabilities, higher level Selenium abstractions, and JIRA integration which all look promising.\n\nOverall, this is a great soup to nuts book on BDD.  Smart builds a solid conceptual foundation, and he follows this with an excellent illustration of the various tools to implement BDD.  I recommend this as a starting book for the patient or as an excellent follow-up to Markus Gartners ATDD by Example (which is more of a fast paced primer).\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21306", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Daniel has never been overly ambitious. He could easily heal cuts and bruises but didn't work to develop his stronger powers. In fact, if asked, he would tell you sleeping was his specialty. That changed the moment he saw his beautiful Firefly covered in blood. From that moment on he dedicated himself to getting stronger, more powerful. His one goal; return Mako to health and restore her beautiful smile. This time she needed Him, Daniel. And once he repaired the damage he had caused to their relationship, he restored her health, her legs. Now Mako needs him again. She's been taken and he needs to be stronger than ever to help bring her home. In order to do this, he must face his past. He must deal with his family problems, his guilt, and his fears. He must claim every part of himself. For Mako, he can finally do this.\n\nDaniel is an emotional journey. I read the first third of the book through eyes blurred with tears. Daniel and his big brother Michael suffered a childhood that should never have been. The loss of a mother. The abandonment of a father. The emotional and physical abuse of a stepmother. The ridicule of a kingdom. Thank the stars they had each other. The love between these brothers; their devotion and support to one another are beautiful. It's an unbreakable bond that helped them survive. Their nanny Marissa was the one who ensured that one day as men they would have the ability to love. She was their one safe place in the world. The one person who was always there for them, loving them, trying to protect them. My heart broke for these two sweet boys. As a mother of boys, it was almost too much for me. Daniel's pain, insecurity, and guilt destroyed me. His attempts to fix his family and home broke my heart a little more. My anger and disgust at his father are immeasurable. I have a negative view of the entire Angel race at this point. It seems the truly good Angels are the exceptions. The fact that Daniel (and Michael) turned out to be kind and caring is a testimony to inner character. Daniel's not perfect but he is exactly who Mako and the team need. I have been frustrated with his behavior in the past. That is gone. It's extraordinary that he found the bravery to love at all. Holding back, needing more time to open up to Mako is now completely understandable.\n\nThis story is Micheal's. It does little to advance the overall story arc but does set the pieces in place for the search and recovery of the Princess. I believe that these books featuring an individual star knight make this sensational series even better. The in-depth look at each guy, his background, his key experiences told in his POV add depth that we could never get otherwise. To have complete understanding of who they are, how they think, and why they act and react like they do complete the story. To experience their love and absolute devotion to Mako and the bond they have with each other as her Star Knights, friends, and brothers make me love them even more. The way Yumoyori works them into the series is perfect. The Starlight Gods is definitely one of my favorite on-going RH series. I am grateful there are still many stories waiting to be told!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "21309", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Putting everything in the context of history shed light on some of the more interesting women we get to read about.\n\nIn the first half of the book, Yalom was very careful to point out that we only have stories from women of a certain class, race, and/or religion, and that we shouldn't make too many assumptions about how women really lived as wives from those few anecdotes. However, in the later part of the book, as we get into more modern times, Yalom seems to have lost this caution. From my reading, it seems that she assumes the experiences of the cultural majority (usually white, middle-class, Judeo-Christian women) are the experiences to highlight, in spite of the fact that we now have numerous historical documents and evidence to show the lives of women in the minority.

I wanted a comfortable daily shoe that I could use to walk the dog, run errands, etc....  Of course I thought of Vasque since I love their hiking boots! I found the Monolith Low Hiking Shoes and ordered them in the same size as my Vasque hiking boots.  They look cute and they're not a heavy shoe so right out of the box I was happy. Just like with my hiking boots, I removed the insole and slid my orthotics inside. Then I put them on my feet and my love for these shoes plummeted. They were so uncomfortable! When I wear my Vasque hiking boots, it feels like they're hugging and supporting my feet. When I put these Monolith Low Hikers on, there was a tightness through the front and top of my foot and I couldn't wait to get my feet out of them! I don't think I've ever had a more incomfortable pair of shoes! I was sad to have to send them back since they were so cute but there was no way I was going to be able to wear them. I have no idea why these fit so differently from the hiking boots I have but the different is pretty drastic (with my Talus Treks I can wear a heavier tube sock but the Monoliths were so tight even with my very thin hiking sock liners).\nScore:"}], "output": "1 \n", "formatted_output": "1", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21326", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

He proved he could still crack the top 40, something I'm sure no one thought possible at the time. I remember when this came out, and I remember thinking it was average. Now however, it actually is better than \"Vive Le Rock\". There's something here, if you listen past the late 80's production gloss that still resonates well today (better than \"Vive Le Rock\" at least). There are a number of good tracks here like \"Rough Stuff\", \"If You Keep On\", \"Manners & Physique\", \"Can't Set The Rules About Love\", Bright Lights Black Leather\", \"Young Dumb And Full Of It\" and \"Anger, Inc.\" By far, the worst track is \"U.S.S.A.\"\n\nIt's too bad this isn't digitally remastered (due to it being on a different record label from his first six albums). His next album would not be released by the evil record company execs, so we'd have to wait five more years until Adam would re-emerge with \"Wonderful\".\n\nSo, overall, not a bad album, but a little dated with the late 80's production and instrumentation. It's not as timeless as \"Prince Charming\" or \"Friend Or Foe\", but worth picking up for the Ant fan.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "21354", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The writing is gripping, demanding that the pages are turned. The story is exceptional!\n\nWithout giving too much away, the author makes all characters in this story extremely real. Despite the somewhat dark subject matter this is a story of hope, life affirmation and all that it brings. The relationship between Charlotte and Porter is honest, they might be in love but they have real problems and they aren't all solved with a snap of the fingers. I loved the way the romance developed in this story. Their slow transition from formality to a deeper understanding and eventually, to love was beautifully played out.\n\nPorter Reese understood me. Not in sentences, but in the silence. ~ Charlotte\n\nOur situations were different, but the same shade of black painted both of our souls. But, as I clung to him, trying to perform the impossible task of collecting myself, it hit me that the darkness was all wed ever have. ~ Charlotte\n\nThe Darkest Sunrise is a heartachingly beautiful book about the power of love, the true meaning of family, and the choices we all make.

I went on a hunt for this book because I saw the trailer for the movie release.  Conveniently releasing right around Valentine's Day, the trailer looked like it teeters on the edge of a great love story and a hokey attempt at romance.  The book falls over on the latter.

The sum of all his knowledge comes from what he sees on his television set and what he has learned tending his garden.  He doesn't read.  He doesn't write.  He really doesn't know that there is a world outside of his garden.\nWhen the old man dies, Chance is thrown into a world about which he knows nothing.  His one advantage coming into that world is that he has the old man's hand-me-down suits which are impeccably tailored and are old enough to have come back into style.\nBy chance, Chance is injured by a chauffeur driven limousine belonging to a very rich and influential man.  (Thank goodness for the suit he is wearing!  Through no fault of his own, he looks rich and successful.)  He gives his name as Chance, the gardner and it is misunderstood as Chauncey Gardiner.  His vast experience in things worldly, gained from viewing television, tells him that if someone tells him that is his name then that is his name.\nWhenever Chance, now Chauncey, enters into a conversation, he speaks of what he knows, the garden.  Within a very short time, his replies, such as, \"For everything there is a season,\" in response to a question about the future economic climate, are taken to be the astute observations of a brilliant man.\nThese meaningless utterances, coupled with his total lack of a background, make him into a media idol and, seemingly, the ideal candidate for Vice President of the United States.  After all, if he has no background, there's nothing in it for the opposition to attack, and his garden variety, visionary, comments don't have enough substance to be contradicted.\nAs a commentary on the media culture that existed when Kosinski wrote BEING THERE, and which still exists today, I don't think this book can be beat.  Further, as a reflection on the ability of the \"unwashed masses\" to distinguish between hype and substance, it's rather frightening.\nThe book begins with the ambiguity of Chance's origins and ends in an ambiguous scene that leaves Chance's future open to interpretation.  I think that this is the only intellectually honest ending possible for BEING THERE.  I recommend BEING THERE for Kosinski's commentary on our media driven society and because of the inferred questions it asks us about ourselves.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21371", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

There are two feature films and two made for French television dramas in this two-disc set.

I don't even know if that's a good thing or not. All I know is that if a book affected you like the way this book affected me, it only means one thing: IT IS BRILLIANT AND MADE BY A GENIUS MIND.\n\nYep, I think Veronica will approve it.\n\nJulep (if that's her real name) is a con artist. A grifter. And she's good at what she do. After all, she learned from the best grifter she knows: her father. Who is, by the way, MISSING.\n\nThe gem in this book is Julep. She is well defined and incredibly believable for a 16 year old con artist. I notice every details when it comes to this kind of plots because even though this book is Fiction, I still want a hint of reality to it. You can say that the author really researched and crafted Julep very well. As far as I'm concerned, not only Julep, but every character in this book is plausible. I even have this weird connection with Julep's father even though I've seen only small parts of him and mostly through Julep's memory only.\n\nThe romance isn't the main focus of the story because it's more about finding Julep's dad but it's another reason to love the story. The romance aspect didn't annoy me at all and the instead, it added flare to TMIL's plot. There's drama, of course. But this is the kind of drama that you'll find yourself very invested in. And I have to admit that there were some things that happened that squeezed my heart and felt like it was rip apart but I willingly accepted it. Sometimes I wish I can sell my emotions for awhile. Sigh..\n\nTrust Me, I'm Lying really delivers. It will keep you guessing, will shock you with its twist and turns and will made you laugh along the way. Julep is not someone you forget that easily and you'll find yourself wishing that you have a real life friend like her. I recommend this to readers who is looking for a well done mystery with a sassy heroine. You will love it. Overall, Trust Me, I'm Lying is a lovely debut book!

The story has two teenagers driving home from college only to encounter a huge van that tries to run them off the road.  Subsequent encounters prove it to be a flesh-eating demon that requires bodyparts to survive and needs something from the two teens.\nWith movies such as this there are always pitfalls to go along with moments of ingenuity.  For the first half hour this plays very much like a traditional horror movie such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', thankfully devoid of irony and clever smirks; this is horror at its most basic.  Indeed, there's an awful lot of moments that will make you jump up in your seat.  Despite being highly traditional though, there are several moments of genuine surprise here.  When the van bears down on the two teens it's actually very scary and the chamber made from dead bodies really makes the flesh creep.\nHowever, once this threat is revealed as a demon a lot of the suspense rapidly disappears.  Although the special effects are impressive, nothing really takes away from the fact that what's been scaring the audience all this time has been an organ-harvesting demon.  Quite simply, this is silly, even if it is different.\nThankfully the young teen actors are very good indeed, and manage to bounce off each other incredibly well in the early comic scenes that they share.  What 'Jeepers Creepers' proved was that audiences have tired of the same smug horrors which quickly followed the ground-breaking 'Scream'.  This is back-to-basics stuff and cleverly creeps its audience out with implication rather than gore.  It's definitely one to watch, if not only for the fact that it is so different from a lot of other modern horror out there.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21394", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

People who use their intellects will balk. Did you know that if you are on a Boing 727, the odds are that two people sitting together will have the exact same birthdate! A miracle! I see auras. The truth is that anybody can see auras. Out of the side of  your eyes. And you can see all of this in Kirlian Photography. So I'm a  real \"Hard Sell\"! Also, when people tell you they have seen Jesus  or Bugs Bunny, you will have to rule out imagination, schizophrenia, drugs,  lying, and wishful thinking. I personally have seen the spiritual eye 30-40  times between the eyebrows. The yellow ring is full of a field of blue.  Right in the middle of the blue field is a five-pointed silver star that  flickers. This is all very beautiful. I have tried to time the stars  flickering. I ascertain that it flickers about twice a second. I have had some experience  despite my concrete sceptism. I have read this book 8 times. Words do have  an effect on the brain. These affirmations make imprints (or what Hindus  call \"samskaras\") on the brain. Now this depends on two factors  according to Yogananda. One. Repitition. Two. Intensity. The more of these  two, the deeper the cuts into the brain. The deeper the cuts, the more you  bypass the concious and cut impressions into the subconcious. The  subconscious is really quite stupid. It will simply follow what it is fed.  It's like a computer. Or what you might call a \"biocomputer\".  It's mostly tied in with the autonomic nervous system. But it will do  brillantly what you feed it. It is fed from the concious mind. Yogananda  tells you how to cut deeper and deeper into the brain. Say out loud,  \"I am old\". Then whisper it. Then affirm it mentally.  That is,  say it mentally. Eventually, this becomes \"subconcious chanting\".  What is that? The SUBCONCIOUS WILL KEEP ON CARRYING THE CHANTING BY ITSELF  ALL THROUGH THE DAY AND NIGHT. This changes your brain and your entire  body. You will begin to hump over and acquire some wrinkles eventually.  This is not strange IF YOU REMEMBER THAT THE SUBCONCIOUS IS MERELY A  MACHINE WHICH CARRYS OUT ORDERS. That's all we skeptics really have to  know. There is also supercious chanting. Now this is an Einsteinian concept  rather than a Newtonian. Everything is connected to everything else. We can  see this with our eyes. The chanting eventually cuts so deep with  repitition and intensity that it begins to affect our environment. At this  point, the chanting is causing an environmental change around us.  Those of  an Einsteinian bent will understand this. So our words have a deep affect.  Miracles have happened for me with these chants. MAYBE! I'm a sceptic. If  one of Yoganda's books fly off my shelf at this moment, I am not going to  exclaim that it is the work of God while I am writing this review.  Scientists call this  \"Select Abstraction\". That is, you assign  all coincidences to a certain cause. How about an  earthquake? Or the book  being ready to drop out of the shelf? These chants work. BUY THE BOOK. It's  not like seeing the silver star. But we skeptics can be assured through  cause-and-effect experimaentation on ourselves that they do indeed work.  You can feel it.

This book grabs your attention on page one and never lets it go. It is a definite page turner. Simone is the ideal heroine. She is feisty, mouthy and goes after what she wants. Even when she is thrown into a situation that seems like it has no optimistic outcome, she fights for what she believes in. I admired the way she handled her situation. I'm not sure I could have done what Simone did. Camyrn, Kael and Ean are three of the hottest men around. Although they are not human, they exude sex. The men are arrogant and overbearing but that is because that's all they've ever known. It seemed very unlikely that Simone and these men could ever get along. There were times I wanted to slap them, but I actually did see their point of view. Ms. O'Connor has done a fantastic job writing the characters. Although they antagonized each other, they also fit well together despite or maybe because of their differences. The secondary characters are well written and help to make this a well rounded story. The villains are extraordinary and I hated them. Alien Penetration is a wild rollercoaster ride of plot twists, wonderful characters and a great story line that will keep you on the edge of you seat through out the entire book. I didn't want the book to end and would like to revisit Simone, Camryn, Kael and Ean.  - Jules\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "21396", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

But, it hardly deserves the accolades and the attention it is getting. Controversial? Yes.\nA masterfully crafted work of art? No. There are many \"movie\" type action sequences and convenient escapes by our protagonists; it becomes a bit cliched to the reader after a certain point.\nThis, for the most part, was a slow read that was tough to get through because of its lack of depth. The only deep part of the book is the seemingly endless \"facts\" that are discussed about Da Vinci, the church, the Holy Grail and this  amazing code that has seemingly no end to it. The characters are constantly trying to solve the code, but the process of bringing these facts to play is absurd.  And these \"facts\" are really not real facts (only facts for the sake of the book).\nMuch of the dialogue, combined with stereotyped good guy/ bad guy situations,  make for a mediocre story. The protagonists manage to just get by the bumbling police, who manage to blow several key opportunities to get them. It would not have been surprising to hear the police captain scream \"Don't blow this case\" to a lowly, but eager rookie officer who wanted in on the chance to nab our heroes.  The characters are either evil and corrupt, or good and benevolent; it is as simple as black and white.\nIf there is an aspect that should be applauded it is Brown's ability to take many aspects of history (as factious as they are) and attempt to intertwine them into the plot of a story.  But, these attempts fail because they beg too many convenient coincidences, and the authenticity of the characters is seriously lacking as a result.\nThis book will probably end up being some major motion picture in a few years, with big stars and a big budget.\nAs far as being a unique work of fiction, this fails.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21411", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Unfortunately, the sound quality was always terrible.  Since I didn't want to give up on satellite radio, I had to find a more direct method of transmitting the sound to the car stereo of my Mazda 5.\n\nMazda sells an audio adapter kit, and I'm sure it's really nice, but it was way too expensive for me.  The GROM adapter is about half the cost and got good reviews elsewhere, so I gave it a shot.  I'm glad I did.\n\nFor starters, the sound from my XM radio is now awesome.  Crystal clear and no problems whatsoever.\n\nThe reason why I gave this only four stars is because it because it's clunky.  Removing the radio to install the adapter was a real pain, but I can't fault the adapter for it.  However, the \"box\" of the adapter sits unsecured inside my dashboard, because there's no mounting bracket.  In addition, the audio cable just sticks out of my dashboard.  So I would have preferred something that fit my particular Mazda vehicle better.  For instance, maybe I could drill a hole in the dashboard and fit a 1/8\" jack, so it would have been nice for the adapter to come with hardware that let me do that.  In other words, the adapter should have included some way to avoid having a cable dangling from the dashboard.\n\nRegardless, if you have a compatible Mazda vehicle and you want to listen to MP3s or satellite radio, then I strongly recommend this product.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21417", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I tried them on in my house, walked from the kitchen to the living room and back, and when I sat down to look at them, noticed that the felt had already started rubbing off, which definitely renders them un-returnable.  Since it adds no cushioning for the foot, and their ribbon-type logo is underneath the felt and doesn't seem like it will ever rub off, I think they're doing this to render them non-returnable.  See my uploaded photo.\n\nThe pink and orange is very vibrant, exactly as in photos.  The stripes are fun and playful.  Though they remind me of circus shoes, I will wear these with jeans, etc. as an any day shoe.\n\nI purchased an 8 1/2 (my normal size wearing shoes without socks) and they fit right on, true to size.  I am impressed with the cut.  I've been trying on a lot of dress shoes lately and many, even very well known reputable brands, come to a fairly sharp angle at the back of the heel, which, even with a gap, often rubs uncomfortably and causes blisters.  These are the first to not have this problem, being nicely shaped to the foot (at least my foot) and nicely ergonomic.  I have medium-slightly wide feet, and these fit comfortably enough in the toe box (my right foot, which is a tad bigger, could use a bit more).  I do not have issues with arch support (except on completely flat shoes) and these seem to have normal.  The heel is substantial and very stable.  There is a small amount of toe cleavage visible.\n\nI wish that they would put more padding for the ball of the foot, both on the inside and the outside.  It is minimal.  More padding would improve them a lot.\n\nLater... I have now worn them out twice and they are getting filthy already.  The cloth is just too absorbent to dirt.  I purchased a spray stain guard and sprayed them, but it has made little difference.  There is a reason shoes are usually made of leather and other synthetic materials.  These are not going to last.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "21419", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

([...])\n\nI'm going to start with the fact that at the time when I went to read this, I had been in a complete reading rut for a long while, it took me months to read just one book when normally it took me from a few hours to a few days to complete a book, depending on their size. But then I decided to try and get back into my reading and I remembered the Morganville Vampires series. I owned books one through five at the time, and I hadn't read them yet. Except for the fact I started reading Glass Houses a long time ago when I checked it out at the library, but then had to bring it back before I had finished it.\n\nI had only gotten not even halfway through. After my birthday one year I decided to order all the books that were currently out in the series with a Books-a-Million gift card I had received. I remembered how much I had loved the bit I had read and so I grabbed Glass Houses, hoping it would be the book to snatch me out of my reading rut.\n\nAnd guess what, it did! The world Rachel Caine has created is so different from the normal worlds of books with vampires in them. Truthfully, it is so hard to find a good vampire book these days with a unique plot and storyline, because sadly most of it has already been used before, which is really sad to a vampire lover like me.\n\nWhen I learned that the town was run by vampires and that all the humans that lived in Morganville knew, it completely blew my mind! And not only that, but the vampires in the Morganville Vampires are bad! Not all of them are, but most.\n\nAll I can say it that Rachel Caine is brilliant. She has also become an inspiration to my writing, so kudos to her for that as well.\n\nI really loved the main characters. Claire kind of annoyed me at first, but later as she started developing more she became more real to me and less annoying. I absolutely love, love, love Eve. And Shane and Michael as well, god they are hot! But Eve is my favorite character.\n\nAll I can say about Monica though is that I wanted to slap her 99% of the time. I really wish someone would kick her butt.\n\nNot only do I love the characters, and basically everything else about this book, but the cover. It's really pretty. I know you should never judge a book by its cover, but a good story should always have a beautiful cover. Am I right?\n\nThe end of this book ended with a complete cliffhanger. Seriously made my jaw drop and run to my shelf to grab the second book, The Dead Girls' Dance. Sometimes I hate cliff hangers, but in this case I had the next book so it didn't bother me much. Except for the five seconds it took to grab the next installment.\n\nOverall, I thought that Glass Houses was a great first edition to the Morganville Vampires series and it's now one of my favorite series. I highly recommend this book. It's a must read for vampire lovers, fantasy lovers and just book lovers. If you haven't read Glass Houses you should really grab a copy of it, or at least borrow it from the library or a friend. You do NOT want to miss out on this book.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "21429", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

He's an American-Chinese man who has become interested in his family's history, specifically the fabled porcelain that his great-great grandfather may (or may not have ) buried in his mainland China backyard before the revolution. But hardly anyone knows much about it and those who do seem to want to keep him from knowing more.\n\nThus starts his long, winding tale of travel, employment, language barriers, history-delving and relative-meeting in both mainland China and Taiwan. Hsu's saga not only encompasses his family's past, but also it's present and the diaspora of various members - present and missing. And it also covers China's past in great detail: the history of porcelain, architecture, government and more. While the tale does get off the path now and again, it does so with rewards. We're treated to a compressed history of China and the spasmodic idiocy of the revolution and all of it's crazy outcomes in various eras. To say his family was affected deeply is putting it lightly. But then, who's family in China was not? We're also given a fairly good history of China's ceramic industry throughout time and up to the present. China knows they are the cradle of all things ceramic and they are just now getting that cache back, although in pieces and at high prices.\n\nHsu goes through a plethora of locations, relatives, language situations and shards. Many, many shards. However, the problem I had with this saga is how long it took to get to the shards and the winding, twisting road was not something I found particularly enjoyable and the writer veers off-course into other territories quite often. Many of the first chapters should be chopped down, in my opinion and have far too many examples of minutiae for my taste. Things start to get interesting around page 130, when Hsu starts to actually experience interesting things and places.\n\nThe writing style is good, if not a bit long-winded. I think the book could easily be pared down to about 250 pages instead of the 360 it now sits at. There is far too much unnecessary information about things not necessarily related to his family or porcelain per se.  While I didn't mind reading about the other subjects, they're not what interested me specifically and the book never actually lives up to it's title other than a few shards of what could have been his families original wares making their way into the author's possession before he leaves. As to how that happened, I won't ruin the story. But be forewarned, it will take nearly as long for the reader to make the discovery as it did for Hsu to actually live it.\n\nA good read, but slow going. I recommend the book to those interested in Chinese porcelian, history and culture.  Four Stars.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "21437", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Only output the score and nothing else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Review:\nI'll never forget the first time I played Odin Sphere. I had endured a nightmarish six months where, in seemingly endless and rapid succession, I endured one horrific experience/circumstance after another, culminating in the loss of two loved ones very dear to me in death. I was stuck in the darkest time of my life. After weeks of utter despair and depression, I downloaded Odin Sphere off of PSN, booted it up, and for the first time in weeks, I started to feel hope again. It was the turning point. It may seem silly to say this, but while playing Odin Sphere, food started to have a taste again, I started to care about things in my life again, and while the loss and painful memories of the recent past still hurt, my life started to seem a little better each day. Odin Sphere was a magical experience that lifted my spirits, cleansed my palate, and helped me appreciate how beautiful and joyful of a gift life really is. I'll never forget the wonderful experience it has to offer. Why did this game have such a profound effect on me? Let me try to explain...\n\nThe story in Odin Sphere is actually the tale of five different characters interwoven into one mosaic of destiny, depicted as story books read by a girl named Alice in her attic's library. The land of Erion is embroiled in war as two different kingdoms vie for a tool that will grant them supremacy, while others nervously watch from the sidelines (but inevitably end up involved too). Each character you play as has their stakes in one kingdom or another, either by choice or through obligation, and some are loyal only to themselves. A character you came to love as the protagonist of one story may be an enemy in another tale, and a character that was once an antagonist that you hoped to defeat all of a sudden becomes a much more sympathetic figure when you see the story from their perspective. It's very difficult to weave several stories with all their various offroads and intersections into a cohesive whole, but Odin Sphere does so with aplomb. There's a helpful place in the menu where you can see how each timeline matches up to each other in the overall scheme of things. Make no mistake, the story of Odin Sphere is not a bright tale where everyone gets a happily ever after (although some indeed do), and I think that's what I love most about it. Despite all of its fantastical whimsy and imagination, the world of Odin Sphere is very true to life, full of tragedies on a scale both personal and vast. Battles ravage the land, pointlessly cutting short the lives of countless souls, and some truly good characters meet tragic fates while evil ones get off seemingly scot-free. It's very realistic. However, even in a world ravaged by war and tragedies, there are bright glimmers of hope that make life worth living. Every character has a very unique story to tell, some of personal salvation, others of duty to nation-before-self, and even an incredibly touching story involving both redemption and love. It's a very complex and touching tale that Odin Sphere aspires to tell, and I have to give credit to the game for not only telling one story incredibly well, but five of them. Bravo!\n\nThe art and sound in the game definitely compliments that story really well. Vanillaware has become famous for their instantly recognizable art design that focuses on gorgeous hand-drawn characters and painterly backdrop settings. It's a style that just lights your imagination on fire. Every character is so cool looking and instantly recognizable, and that extends from the main five characters to almost every major player in the story. Seeing the massive, almost celestial King Odin, or the way the Shadow Knight Oswald transforms from gentle-but-composed warrior into a nightmarish beast, is just unforgettable. Same goes for the settings, each of which is a joy to visit, and that's a good thing because every character will visit the same general locations. Thankfully, each locale is so cool, you won't be bored to go back.  Visually, Odin Sphere is one of the ultimate cases to be made that art design and vision is far more important to the visuals of a game than trying to push the boundaries of ever-aging tech limitations. The sound is also well done. The voice acting in this game is exceptionally well done, in my opinion, featuring some top-talent voice actors to fill the roster. They all do a very good job bringing the characters to life. The very distinct, distinguished soundtrack from Basiscape is suitably whimsical, dramatic, and fantastical. The presentation overall is just wonderful.\n\nAt its core, Odin Sphere is a beat-em-up action/adventure RPG. A mouthful to be sure. Like the story and presentation, Odin Sphere's gameplay is both immediately satisfying and also satisfyingly deep and engaging. Each character promises a very different gameplay experience, as each character plays totally differently from one another, requiring you to change up your general strategy each time you start a new campaign. For instance, Gwendolyn, the first character you have access to, is the most balanced, making it easier and enjoyable to get used to the game's combat system. The others all play differently, Oswald is highly mobile and can transform into a powerful beast, Mercedes is weak but can fly and her attacks are ranged, Cornelius is a canonball fighter, bouncing all over and avoiding hits, and Velvet is a high-chaining character with long-range chains. At its core, most of your time will be spent beating up and tearing through hoards of bad guys, all of whom will differ in variety and abilities depending on your location. This is where the depth sets in...\n\nWhen enemies fall, they release lights called \"phozons\" that you can vacuum into your special weapon, called a \"Psypher.\" OR, you can plant seeds from a massive variety of plants that will automatically vacuum the number of phozons required to grow their \"fruitage.\" This is where one of Odin Sphere's main quirks lie. Phozons are used to upgrade the level of your weapon, increasing your offensive capabilities, BUT you also gain levels for your health by eating items that replenish health. There's also a really deep cooking system in play where you can create more complex dishes to eat. The more complex your dish, the higher HP you regain when eating and also the higher health XP you earn. Add in a really deep, nuanced alchemy system that encourages mathematical thinking and strategy for crafting special potions you'll need to survive and you get a very deep gaming experience indeed. It's so interesting and I love that. Odin Sphere takes an immediately satisfying gameplay style and adds mentally engaging, nuanced facets that makes this a game that will challenge and engage you the whole way through. And make no mistake, this game will challenge you. It is HARD. If you don't employ proper planning and strategy, this game will kick your arse six ways to Sunday. Some may not like that, but I do. Add in awesome boss fights and you get a game whose gameplay is as memorable and exciting as its story and presentation.\n\nOdin Sphere is such a whimsical masterpiece, it's really hard to encapsulate its greatness and beauty in a short review. Vanillaware has gone on to make several wonderful games since this one, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Muramasa-The-Demon-Blade/dp/B00B7ELWAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Muramasa: The Demon Blade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dragon-s-Crown/dp/B007V9QKH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dragon's Crown</a>, but for my money, Odin Sphere stands as their Magnum Opus. It is such a complete game, where every aspect adds to a cohesively masterful experience. From the moment I started playing Odin Sphere, I truly escaped into the storybooks right alongside Alice sitting in her attic, into a whimsical world of pain, loss, tragedy, but also healing, hope, and love. Odin Sphere is a wonderful game I shall never forget, and if you play it, I guarantee you won't either. Give it a chance, stick with it through the challenging learning curve, and I guarantee you will cherish this game too. So buy it (only $10 on PSN!), get lost in the story of the land of Erion, and see this tale of fate to its epic and hopeful conclusion.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "21443", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I saw the CBS interview with Donna Tartt and now understand why her prose is so impeccable. She takes ten years to write a book! She wrote one novel each at the ages of 29, 39 and 49. She is influenced by the writing style of Charles Dickens, which accounts for the incredible descriptive writing she did throughout the novel. The aftermath of the museum explosion extends for a suspense filled eighteen pages (31-48). We see the outcome of the detonation through the eyes of our narrator and protagonist, Theo Decker. This was one of several sections the author wrote that I thought was exceptionally proficient. I also thought introducing Fyodor Dostoyevskys 1868 novel, 'The Idiot' was a clever writers ploy since the Russian novel is a classic study of the conflict between good and evil, which abounds in Tartts novel. Lastly, this might seem trite, but I loved the authors generous use of commas, semi colons and dashes. I know that there are grammatical rules for their usage, but I like a little extra cheese on my pizza (is that a idiom?). What is the story about?\n\nOkay, Theo Decker is a thirteen year old student living in N.Y.C., who gets into dubious trouble in school and gets suspended. Now his estranged mom and Theo head for the school for a meeting. They are early, its raining, so they duck into an art museum to pass some time and see the Dutch artist exposition, mainly Rembrandts The Anatomy Lesson and C. Fabritiuss The Goldfinch. Theo is mesmerized with a red headed girl (Pippa) his age accompanied by a old man presumed to be her grandfather (Welty). As Theo and his mom walk to the gift shop, mom decides to go back to see the painting one more time, leaving Theo in the shop alone when he spots the girl and her companion again. Just as he approaches the girl, a massive explosion occurs in the museum. He is covered in debris and disoriented. He hears the old man groaning and goes to him. The girl is nowhere to be seen. The old man is dying. Where is mom? The old man spots a dusty rectangle of board covered in rubbish and wants Theo to get it. My God, its The Goldfinch painting. The old man (Welty Blackwell) wants to know where Pippa is. Theo doesnt see her (why am I using so many short sentences?). He gives Theo his heavy gold ring with a carved stone and tells him to take it to: Hobart and Blackwell. Ring the green bell. Theo finally finds his way out of the museum, dazed and hurt, unable to get anyone to help him. He still has the painting. He walks home in the rain to wait for his mom to return from the museum. Guess what, shes dead and suddenly Theo is alone.\n\nIs Theo going to experience the same problems that Pip in the Charles Dickens novel, 'Great Expectations' endured? Maybe. Mom doesnt come home, a social worker from the Department of Child and Family Services calls and the story is off and running (idiom alert). The reader is going to encounter the peculiar Barbour family, agonize over Theos life with his dad in Las Vegas, meet his crazy Russian friend, Boris, and delight in Theos relationship with Hobart (Hobie). What happened to Pippa? And what about The Goldfinch? Who has it and what will become of it? It is the focus of the story, yet the author occasionally seems to forget about it for a hundred pages, or so. I guess that can happen in a 771 page novel. The cigarette smoking, vodka drinking, and drug using Boris is a character that the reader loves and periodically hates. The author has the unique ability to make the reader like the characters she wants you to like (Theo, Hobie, Pippa, Mrs. Barbour, Andy and sometimes Boris) and hate the characters she wants you to hate (Theos dad, Boriss dad, Lucius Reeves, Tom Cable and sometimes Boris). Can this lady write, or what?\n\nAlright, now for the flaws. When the reader gets to page 643... suddenly its a race to the finish line, the author cant wait to get to page 771. Why? The novel was plodding along nicely for 642 pages and probably nine years of Donna Tartts life. If you are writing a book that long, what difference does it make if the novel is a couple hundred pages longer? The extra pages would have given the author the time needed to develop all the new characters that turned up near the end. Lastly, what was that life and death tirade (in the last five pages) all about? Dont get me wrong, I loved the book...its just that it could have been better.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.79}, {"id": "21444", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Let's start with the fact that I am an old(ish) women, it's been a long time since I was 16! But with this book, I was transported back to those days of emotionssooo deep that they literally hurt! The feelings that stab you in the chest and knot your stomach because you feel them so deeply that you can't breath for a second or two. That's what this book has done to me. The characters are so in-depth that I felt all of their swirling emotions.\n\nLexie is very mature for a 16 year old so I think it was easier to connect. Killian is a brooding, sexy, scary, 17 year old biker in an MC club, he knows no happiness and his direction in life is blinkered to just becoming a full-fledged, patched, member of the Sons Of Templar MC. The world moves when Lexie and Killian meet. They are so in love that they are inseparable and they say The. Most. Romantic things to each other I've ever heard! (From teenagers) Swoon. But the story was more than these two, Lexie's Mum and Zane, another member of SOT, hit it off and it seems like a new happy family with big, scary, gorgeous bikers. Theres also the boys in Lexie's band that are a big part of it too! Loved Sam, loved his personality. You also get the obligatory kickass biker drama and some kickass drama that belongs to Lexie and her Mum, Mia. What more could you ask? Really I loved all of the characters, I could keep going all day.\n\nI love MC books by the way! Wow! Just wow! You'll get so many feelings that you'll laugh and cry both in anguish and in happiness.\n\nDefinitely can NOT wait to read the next book!

She has a good job, good friends but she has put off the search for her Prince Charming as all she seems to find are frogs.  As a way to stop her mothers interference in her love life she pretends to have a boyfriend and then decides that the perfect pretend boyfriend would be J.T., the tattoo artist she met at her sisters wedding.\n\nJ.T. owns a tattoo shop and has no problems with the opposite sex but after witnessing the devastation his father felt after being widowed twice he is not certain he wants to go down that road.  He is all too familiar with an interfering family so when she asks for his help he is all in.\n\nThe chemistry was explosive from the beginning but when feelings begin to develop they must decide what they want from life and each other.\n\nAll the interactions between J.T. and Hope were full of heat and humor and that along with the suspense part of the storyline is what made this story so entertaining.

Yeah, me too!  I started Dante's Girl on a flight home and found that I couldn't put it down...even as I waited for my luggage, sat in the cab on the way home or put my key in the lock (which made actually opening the door quite difficult).\n\nSweet baby monkeys...this is a fun read!  It's a romantic story you can fall in love with pure and simple.  An exotic location, a super swoon-worthy boy, a spunky girl and a little adventure...what's not to love?\n\nWe know Courtney for books that are filled with mythology and this is quite a departure.  I'm not sure why she chose to venture in this direction but I'm awfully glad she did.  Maybe I enjoyed it so much because it was a light contemporary read amongst all the paranormal and dystopian books that have been filling my TBR lately.  But, more likely, I enjoyed it because I fell in love with the characters and it put a smile on my face.\n\nReece is so real.  She's witty and smart and sassy.  She has a wonderful inner voice that, my like most of us, keeps reminding her that some of her thoughts are ridiculously crazy.  Dante is just that perfect dream boyfriend.  He's good-looking, sweet, sensitive and \"complicated\".  \"Complicated how?\" you ask?  Well, he's the son of a prime minister, has security following him at all times, friends who can be overwhelming and his life has already been planned out for him.  The expectations of him are high and his commitment to his family is strong.  Enter a girl who changes his outlook and you've got the makings of an interesting situation.  In truth, the secondary characters were really just that.  They were there to help move the story along.  But, there's a very interesting twist with these characters...one that sets up what will be a great second book!\n\nNow, I know some of you will say that it's a typical girl meets boy love story.  And, in some ways that's true.  But, as usual, Courtney's writing flows effortlessly and lures you into the book, making you feel like part of the story.  She speaks to the girl in all of us who longs for her dreams to come true but can't quite believe it when they do.\n\nIf you can open up your heart, remember what it's like to fall in love for the first time and embrace a story that just makes you feel good, then go ahead and pick up this book.  Trust me, you won't be sorry!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21465", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Patrick and Angela are called on to investigate the disappearance of four-year-old Amanda McCready, who lives with an awful, distracted, zero of a mother.  Her inattention to her daughter and her needs is painted so vividly that it is easy to hope that, wherever she is, Amanda's life is somehow better.  This disappearance leads the detectives into a morass of drug dealers and pedophiles and crooked police.\nUltimately, it all leads to a gripping, heart-breaking climax that is pretty much a no-win situation for all involved.  Sure, there are some contrivances in the plot that bring us to this point--as other reviewers have pointed out--but this is still one heck of a powerful book, with vivid characters and a real sense of setting and community.  We can see how the neighborhood gives birth to monsters like Cheese Olamon and Angie's and Patrick's \"friend\" Bubba, while others choose another route for their lives.  This is a step up from the previous book, Sacred, and shows Lehane getting ready for the powerhouse book to come, Mystic River.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "21466", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

And, in particular, it is the story of Drygalski, a German civilian officer charged  to maintain order during the last gasps of German hegemony.\n\nThe story is beautifully told.

My other one is perfect for taking along.\nThe wand, it's leather.  While I prefer leather for most bowls (sound and grip), i found the leather to be a poor choice for one this small.  While it's in my hand, on the pad, it grips the bowl and pushes it around, making me have to actually hold the bowl, not what I want to do.  That hampers the resonance IMO.\nThe bowl itself...  I was disappointed the first use.  But thought it would be the wand issue, which is easily fixed as I have a small just wooden one.  But realized the shape of the bowl is perhaps part of it.  The top curves in, which  my large bowl also does, but it's a 6 inch diameter.  This being so small, it makes for an odd angle to use it at, and the sound is affected as a result.

To my amazement even though I was familiar with some of his tunes, Jordan leaped out and convinced me that he more than any other swing era band was the link between blues, especially Chicago jump style, which was Muddy Waters' trademark, and rock and roll, thanks to a distinctive boogie woogie style that links the blues to the early rock and rollers like super glue.\nPlus, Jordan was funny on top of being an ace musician.  His records sold millions, with cuts like \"Nobody Here But Us Chickens\", \"Let The Good Times Roll\", later covered by Ray Charles, \"Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby\" and the funny \"Open The Door Richard\" and \"Beware Men Beware\".\nThe Tympani Five was a top notch tight act, with Jordan's smooth vocals except when he was being silly, great boogie woogie piano and the occasional guitar licks that cannot be described as anything else but rock and roll.\nThis was not the music of the upper crust.  It was played in dank dangerous clubs in black parts of the cities, and only after rock and roll was deemed safe did Jordan begin to receive his credit due as a rock and roll pioneer.\n\"Saturday Night Fish Fry\" is an excellent collection, rockin' and rollin' at a time music historians would just have soon not admitted was even around.  Pity that his home town of Brinkley, Arkansas has no memorial, not even a street name or roadside historical marker named after him.  I find that pathetic.  Arkansas has had many greats, Johnny Cash, Sonny Boy Williamson, Glen Campbell and Otis Rush among others, and Louis Jordan has long been neglected as a home state musical hero.  For those who love the blues, jazz and are interested in the link between those forms and rock and roll, Jordan is a must have.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "21492", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I have this thing about kitchen appliances and table top \"devices\"...I hate too many, because they clutter a kitchen and counter space.  I usually only have 3 on the counters at all times, and that's including my coffee station, my KA Pro 6 Stand Mixer and a small convection oven...my most used.  Other small appliances are stored away until needed.  I'm also going through throwing away all plastic in the kitchen and replacing with more sustainable materials.\n\nFinally, my spiralizer took a dive to the garbage.  I was getting tired of having to dig it out, set it up and then get to spiralizing.  Too many pieces, blades got stuck, I hated the suction cup feet and it was 80% plastic.  I found myself using a small hand held spiralizer more often.  So, I wasn't spiralizing as often as I had anticipated.\n\nYesterday, I used the KitchenAid Spiralizer attachment for the first time (just received it a couple days ago)...so simple and easy to set up!  I Love KA Attachments.  I only needed to connect 2 pieces into the main attached unit...the spiral attachment desired and the piece for holding the fruit/veggie securely.  It was too simple.  The instructions were simple to follow, and it includes a guide for each attachment blade, type of veggie/fruit and speed to use.  My KA Pro 6 (15 years old) handles KA attachments with ease and this Spiralizer Plus attachment was no exception.  My \"Kitchen Magician\" (Pro 6 adopted name) doesn't even get warm, the organic zucchini and squash sliced quickly with ease and all uniform in thickness.  Even with cutting my zucchini and squash in half, the \"veggie noodles\" were super long...longer than premade spaghetti noodles.\n\nAll Parts are so easy to clean (pre and post use), and the included box (sturdy cardboard with magnetic close and foam dividers) is sturdy enough and houses each piece conveniently.  I'll eventually just put these in a drawer for even more ease of use (like I do with all my other KA attachments), but the \"box\" will last a few years.  I love that the majority of this attachment is all metal.  The large main piece is solid with only enough strong plastic/nylon for inserting/attaching the blades, and the blade attachments just have enough for snapping into place.  It's simple and made well for it's purpose.  I will definitely enjoy using this even daily...very convenient and easy to use.\n\nI haven't attempted using harder vegetation like \"beets\" even with my junky table top spiralizer.  I can't wait to test this KA attachment out further.  It's built sturdy, and I believe it will handle well...just need to follow the suggested blades and stand mixer speeds, in the included guide.  As a caution to anyone using their KA Stand Mixer for use with attachments, ALWAYS feel the top of the machine...if it gets warm, stop and let it rest...then finish.  It is very rare for my Pro 6 to get slightly warm with using any attachment, but machines outside of the professional line will warm up quicker.\n\nI definitely recommend, but I generally recommend KA attachments to those with pro line/professional series; which are built to be work horses in the kitchen...the motor is important; especially if you'll be using attachments and your mixer often; like I do.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "21493", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

While this book does have supernatural beings, You don't have the everyday YA supernatural creatures (Vampires, werewolves, elves, faeries, etc)\n\nMorgan is a High school student who lost her mom 10 years ago. There is this super huge mystery behind her moms disappearance. Nobody knows if there was foul play or if she left on her own. Nothing but her vehicle was discovered.\nWhile at a party Her best friend Ris dragged her to, she sees this guy who is totally checking her out and ignoring the popular girls. Of course they get mad, vicious, and ultimately cause a scene and reminds Morgan that everyone thinks her dad murdered her mom. What a total A-hole right?\nAt school Morgan is known as the psychic (some say shes a freak) To Morgan its just logic and luck, but there is more to Morgan than even she knows.\n\nWe also learn of a group called the Veneret (a group of beings with supernatural powers) who are very interested in Morgan, who we learn is a Natural. The Veneret people have all kinds of \"powers\" ranging from Mind control, Moving objects with their mind, reading people, etc.\n\nThis book is full of thrills, a bit more of a love triangle more of a love rectangle, and is really fast paced. I wouldn't classify this as a full fledge novel. I personally feel a book should be like 250 pages to be considered a novel, but ya this book is on the shorter end. I think maybe 185 pages or so.\n\nNow while I did really enjoy this book, I was left feeling like something was missing. We don't get a happy ending all wrapped up, but it does leave you wanting the next book. But for me it was more than that I can't put my finger on what was lacking with this book. Maybe because It did get wrapped up in 185 pages, maybe I was seeking more back story, maybe more story in general. I'm not too sure. It was one of those that you finish reading and your like hmmm, I like that, but something was missing. I wasn't satisfied after reading it.\n\nbottom line: If your looking for something a little different with a nice fast pace, then I recommend this book.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "21497", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

They use the separation as a last resort to see whether the time apart will restore the energy they need to rebuild their relationship. Along the way they take stock in their shared experiences. Taylor Jenkins Reid offers readers a dissection of a trial separation in the well-meaning but somewhat misguided novel After I Do.\n\nLauren and Ryan meet in college and become inseparable. Graduation brings the obvious next step of moving in together. After a five-year relationship, Ryan proposes and Lauren accepts in bliss. Their marriage will last forever and become an example for all, Lauren knows.\n\nWhat starts out as the ideal situation, however, eventually devolves into bickering and backbiting. Somewhere along the way Lauren loses that breathlessness she used to feel when she would think about Ryan. Now she just feels exasperation.\n\nThings finally get so bad that Lauren and Ryan decide to take a break for a year. They agree not to contact one another for that time, and they give one another the consent to date others. Lauren battles headiness and dread. What will this year bring her? Will she fall in love with her husband again? Will she realize they're better apart? Was she wrong to believe so blindly in their love?\n\nDuring the year Lauren spends time with her siblings and mother. She thinks she can hide her separation from her family, but the truth comes out soon enough and everyone gives their opinions. Through her time with them and their own life experiences that Lauren now shares, Lauren begins to realize that the difficult questions plaguing her relationship have no easy answers.\n\nEveryone has a different view of love and a different process for reaching a working solution. As the months progress Lauren starts to wonder whether shell ever figure out what will work for her. Even if she does figure it out, will the same thing work for Ryan?\n\nAuthor Taylor Jenkins Reid gives readers a novel that entertains at times but will often leave people feeling as exasperated as Lauren does with her husband. Considering the fact that Lauren is the oldest child of a broken home, her fairy tale view of her early relationship sounds almost unrealistic. Her father walked out of her life before she reached the age of five, and 25 years later she has absolutely no issues with men or trust or even what relationships can become. A person could argue that wishing for a prince to sweep her off her feet shows a possible consequence of living in a family that endured divorced. Unfortunately Lauren comes across as too smart and self-assured to get caught up in fairy tale wishes.\n\nAlso, Laurens siblings don't feel three dimensional enough for readers to care much about them. Her younger sister, Rachelher best friend by her own admissiondoesnt have much of a role to play other than float in and out of Laurens life to give her a shoulder to cry on. Reid obviously uses Rachel to portray one of the choices people make when it comes to love and relationships, but because readers don't get enough information about Rachel as a person her choice doesnt seem to matter as much more than a literary device. The same goes for Laurens younger brother and her mother.\n\nLaurens grandmother actually becomes the sage with all the right advice, most of which Lauren deems as too old fashioned. And interestingly enough neither grandmother nor mother tell Lauren that many of her problems problem stem from the fact that shes youngshe met her husband at 19 and married him at 24. After only six years of marriage Lauren has come to the point where she can say to her husband Im not in love with you anymore. What about the simple fact that love and relationships take work, that its about making an active, physical effort? That just because you don't feel in love doesnt mean you cant love the person and fall back in love with him or her?\n\nReaders get the back end of the bickering and fights between Lauren and Ryan, but most of it sounds like issues that all married couples encounter. Nothing special seems to push Lauren and Ryan to the extreme of splitting up for a year. Some may see their separation as a bold, healthy decision, but mostly it feels forced and almost unnecessary.\n\nI recommend that readers bypass After I Do.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "21502", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

For the uninformed, that means slip-on shoes that are made of some kind of recycled rubber foam. They're squishy and comfy and vaguely supportive. These aren't supportive beyond the buoyancy of recycled rubber foam, they're supposed to fit loosely, they are full of holes... and they work flawlessly for what they are.\n\nPros:\n- They fit exactly as expected. Your Croc size is completely unrelated to your actual shoe size, inasmuch as my son wears m6/w8 and his shoe size is 5. His mom wears m8/w10 and her shoe size is 8. So it's completely unrelated, but in general order the size of Crocs that is slightly larger than your shoe size. I marked the fit \"somewhat small\" simply because that's generally true.\n- Interesting design. There is no confusion at school as to whose Crocs these are, so nobody is likely to steal my son's shoes. I would imagine that if this were Kentucky things might be different.\n- Kicking inanimate objects is much less dangerous when wearing these shoes. You just bounce off.\n- You can slide your sweaty feet slightly out of them and press down to make an airtight seal, making \"foot fart\" noises.\n\nCons:\n- Lousy for camouflage. These ones look like the woods. I can't imagine a situation where you would wear Crocs in the actual woods, due to things like branches or brambles or badgers or dropbears potentially biting/piercing directly through them. So if you are buying these in the hopes of disguising yourself in the underbrush, think again.\n- Not \"Achilles Approved\". The single inch-wide strap around the ankle does NOT provide adequate protection from the only part of his body not rendered impervious by the river Styx. It can also be grabbed by your enemies in order to trip you.\n- If you aren't a child, you run the risk of being secretly ridiculed because you are a grown up wearing Crocs outside the house.\n\nAs usual, Amazon delivery was stellar.

Fire Country is a book based around a girl named Siena who lives in Fire Country, which is essentially a desert type terrain that stays hot for the majority of the year.\n\nThis book was truly phenomenal. David has created a unique world, realistic characters, a new governing body and even a fitting language for the setting. Fire Country is a breath of fresh air after all of the unfinished products I seem to have read recently. There was amazing flow, I didn't have to worry about constant interruptions with typos and grammar issues, and it was easy to get lost in this world as I was rooting for Siena and wanting her to rise above her social status and find a way to find true happiness in life.\n\nFire Country happens in a somewhat post apocalyptic world where the population is much less than it was and the life expectancy is much lower with the average person dying at age 30. As someone who turned 30 this year, I found this crazy to think about that this could be my last year. Due to these circumstances, the fire people have rules enacted that involve girls turning 16 to become bearers for the tribe. Once a quarter every girl at the age of 16 must attend a \"call\" ceremony. This means that she will be paired with a randomly selected man over the age of 18 to become his \"bearer\" and to bear his children. Once having a child she will be expected to bear another child ever three years after, until the household is full. A normal full household has 3 \"bearers\" and nine children. Siena is a \"scrawny\" girl prone to daydreams and has no interest in becoming a bearer, and not having any choice in who her call will be. Unfortunately for her, her father is in high-level leadership in the tribe. Through her slight rebellions she comes to discover unimaginable secrets, and just when you think the scandal of the tribe is enough for the book, there is a new and crazy turn of events.\n\nDavid has made such a brilliant story with Fire Country and each character comes to life from Siena to her family and friends and even the ancillary characters. Even when in a depression I couldn't help but chuckle at Siena's dry and witty humor and her sometimes conversations with Perry. Siena shows the world that even a skinny young girl can stand up against what she feels is wrong and find herself in the process.\n\nI give this book 5/5 stars, and cannot wait to read book two in the saga. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys getting lost in a story. Within these pages you will find intrigue, hope, rebellion, betrayal, love, independence and growth.

This is NOT SF, IMHO, but it is an extremelly well done technothriller, where the \"techno\" involves a wildly popular computer game. The gaming is important but does not dominate the book; you need not be a gamer to understand and enjoy it. It also involves jihadist terrorists, Chinese hackers, midwest survivalists, and a whole raft of interesting, mostly likable, characters as well as a plethora of action scenes in vividly described locations around the world. What's not to like?\nAlso do not be deterred by Stehpenson's reputation for long digressions. While I recognize that this is exactly the quality that appeals to many of his fans, it is a quality that keeps me from enjoying many of his books.

Dante has spent his life teaching Rae how to live bravely, allow good things into her life, and accept pain; now, with his dying, he will teach her his final lesson.  The story is narrated in alternate vignettes by Dante, Rae, and the people and animals who share their lives: Rae's husband, housekeeper, friends, and other pets.\n\nHouston's voice is evident in the style of this first novel, and her strengths - language and a sense of life's poetry - are well-displayed.  Each vignette, ranging in length from two to ten pages, is poignant and well-crafted.  But as a novel \"Sight Hound\" is incomplete.  The plot - Dante's illness and eventual death, and the concurrent evolution of Rae's personal relationships - is too simple and unstructured to support a full-length novel, and the incidents that embroider it seem disconnected and incidental.\n\n\"Sight Hound\" is a quality book, worth reading for its craft as well as its message of faith and hope.  But in all this beauty there is little of suspense; it lacks the power and drive of a true novel.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "21525", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.\n\nThe Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.\n\nAssociated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21529", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Inside the unit is a small power strip that will hold three traditional wall adapters nicely.  It also comes with a short pigtail to attach a wall adapter that's too big to fit when plugged in directly.\n\nOnce set up, all the cords are hidden inside the unit.  The only things sticking out are the master power cord and the connectors for your equipment.  You only need to leave an inch or two of slack outside the case for making the connections.\n\nThe unit only has two shortcomings.  First, there's no master power switch the turn the entire thing off.  That less of a problem as the wall adapters go more to switching power supplies and not transformers that are always draining current.\n\nSecond, the newer wall adapters that are design to fit nicely on older power strips by jutting to the side don't work well in this, since the outlets are oriented to allow the wall adapters to have space below them, not beside them.  You can only get two of the sideways adapters ones in the outlets directly--the third would have to use the pigtail.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "21530", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Even when your heart is broken, you're healing from all the hope this book gives you. Even when you're surrounded by the darkness, the light always finds a way in.\n\nSerenity is a 17-year-old (she starts off 16) girl who is abused and has an chocoholic for a mother. She doesnt tell anyone, not even Sky, her best friend who she cant live without and is connected to in a way that they feel what each other feels. Their journey is a tough one, as they make new friends, find love where they never expected it, and secrets come tumbling out while more are made. Darkness attacks them, and sometimes they get lost, but the hope and light keeps them together.\n\nWRITING\nThe authors writing is brilliant. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. I became so invested in these characters and their lives that I forgot I was reading a book. The writing sucked me in and didn't let me out until I finished the book. I thought about the characters constantly while I wasn't reading and imagined the different paths the author could take them. The writing is simply amazing.\n\nCHARACTERS\nThey were great. At times their voices did seem to blend, and the shorties did seem a bit too childish and dependent after they met Rocco and Dereck. Otherwise, they were all strong, compassionate, selfless characters.\n\nJolene and Josh were the parents of the group, protective and watchful, understanding. They listened to their friends and got them back on their feet every time, even if it meant giving them a reality check. They fought endlessly for their friends.\n\nSerenity and Sky, the shorties, were the babies of the group. They were the shortest, but also the most sorrowful as they both have tough home lives. Glued together, they're attached at the hip and feel everything the other feels. Theyre both compassionate characters who appreciate their friends. They make others see the beauty in things. Sky is a bit more outgoing, but they're mostly similar.\n\nDereck and Rocco are the romantic interests, the main protectors of the shorties. They find out what true love is and they treasure it. They are everything a girl could want in a boyfriend, understanding, gentle, kind, loving. They made their girls feel treasured.\n\nROMANCE\nThere is a bit of a love triangle with Dereck and Roccos exes, and the romance is instant, but it doesnt feel like it. We have visions and chemistry that make it seem like it was meant to be, and it was. I adored every moment of the romance, and Im not usually a big fan of it. I was rooting for people, wanted a pair together and another to make it out of the darkness. I never stopped caring, I actually cared too much.\n\nPLOT\nI didn't predict anything correctly at all. There were twists and paths that I never saw coming. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I loved it! It did get dramatic at times, but I didn't really care because I enjoyed the story too much. And while I hate that something so sad had to happen, it brought this story together in a tighter, hopeful way. I cant wait to see where the author takes us in book two!\n\nOverall\nSerenity takes you on a journey of heart ache and hope, where you learn to treasure things in life and appreciate what you have. The author wasn't scared to give us details about the abuse (though it was only a few scenes), or the darkness of depression and sadness. Healing takes a long time, but with loved ones by your side, fighting for you, youll make it through.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "21547", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I really advise you reading the instructions because it's nearly impossible figuring out how to use this without them. I almost thought I couldn't get them to work at all but I sat down with the instructions and finally figured out how to use it.\n\nThis is a very small earbud(as you can see with the pictures I added to this review) but it fits perfectly. I didn't have any issues of the earbud trying to fall out of my ear while I was wearing it. It's really lightweight too so it doesn't hurt while wearing it. It comes with a nice carrying case and cable as well as the very important instructions.\n\nI highly recommend reading the instructions instead of trying to just figure it out. It speaks in two different languages and it was speaking in Chinese to me at fist but once I read the instructions I was easily able to switch it to English. I like that it tells you when it's off so that you know for sure you turned it off. The speaker is slow, but not too slow, she's slow enough with her talking that you can actually understand what she's saying.\n\nThere are two things that make me not like this earbud too much. One is there's this constant ringing noise when it's on but not in use. I did notice it eventually stopping from time to time and it's not noticeable at all when I'm listening to something but it is there every once in awhile when I'm not actually using the earbud but while it's still in my ear. To make this stop I guess you either have to be using it for something (like listening to music and/or being on a call etc.) or turn it off.\n\nThe other thing that I didn't like too much about this earbud is just how loud it was overall. I felt that it was just a little bit too loud for me when listening to music and I had it on the lowest possible setting besides being on mute. So I wouldn't suggest this to those who don't like listening to things loudly. I do, however, suggest this to those who like listening to things loudly or have a hard time hearing because then this will work fantastically for you!\n\nI received this free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "21550", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

If you are a fan of the Bachelor or the Bachelorette, then you will love this novel because is set up the same way as the shows. However, that is not a bad thing because there is so much more when you read The Princes Game because you get an inside look at all the emotions the characters have and show each other. You not only get to know Evan and Sarah, the main characters, but you also get to know some of the supporting characters as well. Lexi Foss has done a wonderful job writing this novel and the way she describes the places in the novel are breathtaking. It is almost like you are there in person seeing the sights for the first time. The way she uses Sarah to describe the other characters is a genuine and unique way. I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves to read romance novels with a bit of a comedy twist to them. But it is more than just a comedy and romance novel.

Using locales as diverse as wintery North Dakota (\"Fargo) ) they tell universal stories of alienation and isolation.  But in \"No Country for Old Men,\" they have hit on the truly scary theme of amoral, mindless violence.  The plot is relatively straightforward: a gang of outlaws gets into a shootout that leaves half a dozen men and animals dead.  A drifter (Josh Brolin) wanders across the scene and finds a suitcase stuffed with two million dollars in drug money. He takes off for parts unknown, followed by the killer, Javier Bardem, and later by the Sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones, and finally by a hitman hired by the drug lords.\n\nThe serial killer stays one step behind the drifter, following a signal from a transponder hidden in the bag. What happens when the killer employs his weapon of choice, an air-powered cattle gun, is too graphic to retell here.\nThat might be the end of the story, but there are several layers involved.\nThe rules of the Old West have been turned on their head, with the lawmen grasping at invisible straws, and the bad guys seemingly beyond the pale of civilization.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily good ensemble cast.  Tommy Lee Jones is as good as I've ever seen him; Josh Brolin is excellent, and Javier Bardem richly deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. Even the bit parts are good (the old man who runs the general store and who survives because of a coin toss)  The cinematography is as gritty and merciless as the terrain where it was shot. Normally, I put the DVD into \"Pause\" a couple of times to attend to personal business, but not with this film, which I watched from opening credits until the end, about which I have my own opinion, but won't spoil it here. Other reviewers have said things about the film's \"unevenness\" but I'm not sure whether those discordant notes are a detriment to the movie.\nYears from now, film critics will include \"No Country for Old Men\" among classics like \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" as one of the greatest westerns.\n\nI give it a five-star review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "21557", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I am deducting one star simply because it is a very, very mild appetite suppressant.

I don't know why, but I find it so much tastier when it is cold. The berry flavor is so enhanced and the cold drink is so refreshing that it's easy to sip on a few 20oz bottles while I work. This has led to me not dipping into the snack baskets at work, which is always a good thing! And basically all I do is fill a normal coffee cup with hot water and two tea bags, steep for 3 minutes, while steeping I fill my 20oz glass water bottle to the brim with ice, then when done steeping I pour the tea over the ice and it fits perfectly.

Arguably better preamps, but lacks some of the other features.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "21576", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

If you love historical, multicultural romance, get your hands on this release when it comes out! Five beautifully written stories set in a pivotal moment of African American history. You really can't afford to skip this anthology!\n\nI never learned much about Juneteenth. It was not taught in schools and my peers seem to consider the day as more of a celebration of slavery than a celebration of freedom. Via the foreward from prolific black romance author Beverly Jenkins, I learned more about Juneteenth. On June 19th, 1865 in Galveston, TX, a proclamation was set forth that all slaves were free. Most celebrated that day January 1 because of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation... however Texas celebrates this day of freedom on June 19th, when the proclamation was read, and their descendants still do.\n\nEach of the stories in this anthology revolve around freedom and civil rights, including the right to love the one you choose to love. Lena Hart tells us the story of Gracie Shaw in Amazing Grace. Gracie is a young southern black woman, promised to a good man in Montana. She must make the trip to meet the man she is contracted to marry by train... where she happens to meet the love of her life, Logan Finley, half Mexican, half Irish. Not only is he not of African descent, but Gracie's family had already received payment for her agreement to marry Robert Whitaker. In addition, there's something in Logan's past that Gracie isn't sure she can forgive.\n\nKianna Alexander shares a story about baker Rosaline Rhodes, who's so sweet on ship builder Will Pruitt, the attraction wafts from the page. When Rosaline is advised to choose a mate who was not a former slave-- in an effort to elevate herself, it was suggested-- it becomes the impetus she and Will need to begin their lives together aboard a Juneteenth cruise down the Cape Fear River. This story was really SO Sweet and one of my favorites!\n\nPiper Hugely is my new #BAE. She writes such glorious historical romances, I'm just in love with her novels! A Sweet Way to Freedom is set Winslow, a Georgia Hamlet. This story appears to be a one-off of the Milford College series that Hugely has been releasing since 2014. Teacher Missouri \"Missy\" Baxter finds her self in a curious predicament, having become pregnant whilst unmarried... But everyone knows who the father is. Arlo Tucker is a man who seems afraid of the future. Watching these two come together was humorous and delightful as well as seeing Arlo come into the man he was destined to be. GREAT read.\n\nAlyssa Cole's Let it Shine is my first read from her but it won't be my last! Her depiction of 'Good Southern Girl' Sofronia 'Sofie' Wallis's forbidden romance with a Jewish neighborhood gentleman Ivan Friedman during the Civil Rights movement was educational and entertaining. The first scene brought a giggle to my lips... I remember hearing the older ladies in the church gossiping about so and so who's pregnant but not married and feeling all kinds of weird about witnessing that. This story reminded me so much of my upbringing as a PK (Preacher's Kid) in a COGIC church... the expectation to be a good girl, because no man wanted a hussy. The idea that everything you do is a reflection on your parents and how you were raised. How unwavering obedience and unquestioned adherence to strict rules and guidelines are expected-- and are the norm. And how a person aches to be defined by themselves, their own achievements and not what the previous generation wants from them. Just as I had to, Sofie had to find a piece of herself and take a step into her future. Hand in hand with, not just a white man... but a Jew. Really great read and it brings to mind a friend of mine that recently married a Jewish man. What a cultural divide to cross... but they're making it, and I have every assumption that Sofie and Ivan lived to grow old together!\n\nThis anthology is important because I believe that we need to know our history, and because people that look like me and share my ancestry fell in love and created the future that I live in. Romance is not just about white faces on book covers... and historical romance is more than Dukes and Queens and Regency. Our historical romances are our pasts brought to life.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.75}, {"id": "21581", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I had been looking at these beauties for about a year. Meanwhile I had purchased a Kicker and a Bose portable Ipod docking systems. When it finally arrived I took it out of its very well packed boxes (3) in total. Of course I immediately hooked my 160GB Ipod classic and I have to say the sound of my music emminating from the Zeppelin was in a word, astounding. With all due respect the other 2 Ipod docking systems which both sounded gr8, the Zeppelin kicked their collective butts to the moon. I was listening to The Rippingtons when my roomie got home. He said it was just like listening to them at the jazz festival in Portland. The bass made the entire house shake while the percussion was crisp and oh! so very well defined. The vocals really sounded like they had the mic right up to their face. I could hear the guitarist fingers slide up & down the neck of the instrument. The musical experience was strong and very well defined. The five amps do their work and very well I might add. They kept each of the 5 drivers seperate from one another. This is the very best reproduction of music I have ever heard. Bar none. As my roomie said, the Zeppelin is worth every penny. I also have a gr8 sounding home theater made up of Klipsch Heresys with a Klipsch sub and a Velodyne sub. All of the other 4 speakers are Klipsch. I love action movies and my system does very well by them all. I've been told this home theater system sound better than any theater in town. I could see myself downsizing to the Zeppelin ONLY. This puppy ROCKS. I am very pleased with my purchase from Amazon. This is why I keep going back and doing more business with these amazing folks. Thank you Bowers & Wilkins.\n\nI have purchased an Audyssey South of Market Ipod dock through Amazon.com and it arrived today. As much as I like this product and the music I get thru my Ipod. I have to say it doesn't even come near the Zeppelin. I still have all of my other systems. I like them all however, the Zeppelin really stands way out in front of all of them. The Zeppelin is my baby and I would not ever be able to part with it. I played both the Audyssey and the Zeppelin at the same time. Although I like the way the new Audyssey sounds the Zeppelin really shines at high levels of volume. It is simply the best :) bar none.\nUpdate: 5/29/15 - The Zeppelin continues to be the best sound system for my I pod. It still sounds amazing. Best sound system I have ever purchased & heard to date !!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21583", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

This is not a good method to deliver good miso, but even setting that aside some of the ingredients chosen are just plain wrong. Tofu yes, but Fried Bean Curd? No. Vegetable oil? Come now, that's not even an ingredient in miso soup. Bonito powder and extract instead of actual flake hana? Getting the picture?\n\nEven at this price this product's formula is way too cheap. Corners were cut, cheap ingredients substituted over quality ones, and everything is covered in sodium. True, this has less sodium than some other formulations of instant miso (as much as 50% less than some popular and highly authentic Japanese formulations made by this very same manufacturer), but the method the sodium is delivered here makes it seem like there is far more sodium than there actually is. Every physical garnish piece: seaweed, tofu, friend bean curd, onion, etc, tastes SOAKED in salt.\n\nIt's not that this is \"bad\" miso soup. It's just not -really- miso soup, it's not a good -imitation- of miso soup, and the quality seems sketchy enough that the manufacturer felt it necessary to include the phrase \"Produced on HACCP CERTIFIED site\" on each individual package. These kinds of claims are almost impossible to verify with products Made in China, but even if this is true it does nothing to change the impression one gets upon consuming their first bowl. Plus, Miyasaka's Made in Japan miso products do not bear any HACCP marking. Why not? Rightly or wrongly it comes down to a single word: Trust. Nobody trusts China for food products at all, and why should they? Their track record is disgusting. Putting \"Produced on HACCP CERTIFIED site\" on the package does nothing to enhance consumer confidence -- if anything it makes it seem like a deception to help sales, what with all the fake organic food, falsely labeled, and contaminated products coming out of China.\n\nIt's astounding that a company that can make sure accurate miso got this product so terribly wrong.

But given that this is actually his first book about his life at La Folie, and the first book I read was the second, technically he's not back.\nWith all of the same places and characters I grew to love in Je T'aime A La Folie (check out Brizmus Blogs Books for my review!), it certainly felt like I was thrown back into a world that I had already grown to love.\n\nC'est La Folie is the endearing story of a man who, on what seems like a whim, decides to move to the middle of nowhere France.  He's looking for adventure, and he's on a quest to become a hero, even though it seems to me he's already somewhat of a hero.  I guess it just depends on your definition of hero.  If you have any interest in life in France, with a little bit of humour and a lot of heart, this is the perfect book for you!\n\nOddly enough, the bulk of this book actually seems to be about the renovations of his home and the raising of his animals, which in and of itself doesn't sound all that appealing.  And yet - he has laced each and every fabulous tale that he has to tell (don't go thinking from that statement that this book reads like a book of short stories - it so doesn't; it is a strong, full-fledged novel) with just enough humour and self-mockery so as to make nearly passage laugh out loud funny.  Or, at the very least, lamentably painful, as the reader can so easily relate to some of his horror stories.  It was great for me to get to know some of the characters from the first book as Michael saw them when he originally met them.  And, though I didn't think it possible, I found myself even more attached to his wonderful sheep and chickens!\n\nMichael's writing is fluid, endearing, enjoyable, and, did I mention, FUNNY!  After living in France for three years, I really thought there was nothing that could make me want to move back, but this wonderful travel story has me craving to live somewhere in \"deepest, darkest France.\"  I'm now convinced that it really must have just been Paris.\n\nThe only real problem that I had with this book was the somewhat vivid descriptions of animal husbandry and animal killing (okay, so the killing descriptions weren't really THAT vivid, but they were still too vivid for me).  I really would have rathered NOT know that he killed chickens, etc. . .  The book would have been wonderful and the perfect length if he had just left those parts out.\n\nAnyhow, wonderful and wonderfully endearing travel memoir, and it comes heartily recommended here at Brizmus Blogs Books.  If you have any interest in France, read this book, and I promise, you won't be disappointed!\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "21618", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I initially wanted a plain white sneaker but didn't want to pay $$$ for the Stan Smith Adidas that everyone seems to be wearing this spring. Besides, plain white is kind of boring.  But when I saw this pair with the silver stars, I decided that they had just the right amount of personalty.  I ordered my regular size, which fit perfectly, and the width is fine for my regular width foot. However, if you have wider feet, they're probably going to be too narrow.  A better choice for wide feet is the Nine West Rukkus Leather Sneaker, which I also ordered but decided to return, not only because they were too wide, but because I decided I liked the silver stars on these Steve Madden sneakers better than the plain white style.  The leather on these Steve Madden sneakers is buttery soft and comparable to higher price brands.  I don't know why this star sneaker was priced so low (I expected to pay quite a bit more for leather) but I'm glad it was because it was within my budget.  I will wear them with everything this spring and summer (2016) when the white sneaker is a fashion must have.  They certainly have a lot more personality than a plain white style but are still just as chic and maybe just a tad bit cooler, lol!  I'm so glad I decided to search Amazon, I never would have found this pair otherwise.  For $30 they are definitely a steal, especially for leather.  I'm thrilled with my purchase and will live in them when the weather warms up.  I highly recommend these sneakers for anyone who wants something chic but different.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21626", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Hence the translators prefer to call these \"Romances\" referring to the European influences than \"Sagas.\"\n\nAt the same time, there are a great many important tales here.  Gautrek's Saga, for example, is included here.  On the basis of comparisons between the deaths of Vikar in this saga and Baldr in Snorri's Edda, de Vries drew important conclusions about the nature of initiation rites among the Norse.\n\nThe one thing I think the translator could have done to make this better would have been to add footnotes explaining some of the elements of the translation (particularly the names).  Some of the humor of the writers fo the sagas has thus been lost in translation.  For example, in Arrow-Odd, it is helpful to know that 'Odd' means 'point' and thus there is a pun on his nickname that is not evident from the translation.\n\nHaving said this, these are all quite enjoyable to read and important for serious Norse studies.

Starting the setup process was relatively easy, but if you're not careful, you can get locked out of the camera. The last step of the setup process requires you to type in a new password so it doesn't use the default one. I use a password generator, so I had a password ready to use. The instructions or text box doesn't say what the restrictions are, but if you paste a password with invalid characters, it won't let you know. I had a password with symbols, and apparently only letters and numbers are allowed, so when I tried to login, the password was incorrect. However, when logging in, you are allowed to type symbols. Long story short, after 2 failed attempts, the camera had locked me out and I wasn't able to get back in until after a factory reset, which required me to start the setup process again.\n\nAfter about half an hour of screwing around with the setup, I was able to get it working, so I decided to try out the other features: live streaming on the phone and in the browser. The browser app is riddled with bugs. First of all, it doesn't work in Chrome, so I used Firefox, but when logged in with Firefox, it required a special plugin to be installed. After installing it, I wasn't able to get a live view, so I decided to give the phone app a try. Same results. The phone app is even worse than the browser app. Things were not looking good at this point, but I decided to give the cloud feature a try, which I'm still not sure how it's different from the live view app, but it has its own mobile app and site. Long story short, the cloud feature doesn't work and is even worse than the live app. Nothing shows up in the feed: just a blank screen with a loading icon.\n\nThe Amcrest software is riddled with bugs and it badly needs to be consolidated. I shouldn't need three separate apps to use the camera. I had to download a setup app, live view app, and a separate cloud app. I think hardware-wise, the camera is actually pretty good, and might work well with some third party software like BlueIris, however, the native apps are complete junk. I didn't want to spend too much time messing around with the software or trying to get it to work with third party solutions, so I decided to return this. I'm still looking around for a decent IP camera, but I might just concede and get a NestCam instead since I know it works.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "21639", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Bill Moseley and Paris hilton's voices are definitely nothing to rave, but at least they were on-key (mostly).

There are other things like a relatively new scanner that still does not work yet.\nThe interface is different from previous versions, and makes you feel like you are in the middle of Super Mario Land.\nXP Home is more stable than previous versions, but it may require a bigger $$$ outlay for other things to keep it all working.\nBottom line in this case was another $200.00 spent on XP PRO to get what I needed.

I do not hate Hans Zimmer, or his music. I've met him on a couple of occasions, and he's an extremely nice and friendly man. As a composer, I think he's very talented. He was a genuinely groundbreaking artist when he first emerged on the scene in the late 1980s, and broke the film music mould when he wrote scores like Black Rain, Backdraft and Crimson Tide. I absolutely adore many of his works, ranging from A League of Their Own to The Prince of Egypt, The Last Samurai and Pearl Harbor. I think Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a masterpiece, and close to being the best score of his entire career. I have a few issues with the way his Remote Control organization has come to dominate the mainstream Hollywood film scoring world, but I admire him as a shrewd businessman, and he did help launch the careers of John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams among others, which is praise-worthy in itself. Having said that, I think Man of Steel is a colossal failure of both musical ingenuity and conceptual approach.\n\nAfter the success of The Dark Knight trilogy, rebooting Superman was almost an inevitability, as was the involvement of director/producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer. In Man of Steel, director Zach Snyder gives us a Superman for the new millennium, imbued with the same aesthetic as Christian Bale's brooding Batman. The original identity that creators Joe Schuster and Jerry Siegel originally gave Superman in 1938 - that of an infallible, just, noble, patriotic super hero - has been largely abandoned. Instead, he is a more angst-ridden, tormented alien soul, stranded on Earth, haunted by the reality of his super powers, and in no way sure of his place in the world or his role within it. This modern obsession with making the unreal more real, darker, and more conflicted worked with Batman: he was always a more shadowy figure, lurking on the edge of society and doing the dirty work that others would not. Superman, however, is supposed to a beacon of hope: morally forthright, acting as a guiding light to whom the people of Earth can look for honesty and truth. This is not the Superman we see in Man of Steel.\n\nThe film itself is a bit of a mess, a combination of hard science fiction and endlessly repetitive action sequences interspersed with a few genuinely effective moments of pathos and emotion, most of which take place during Superman's childhood in Kansas. English actor Henry Cavill plays the titular role, sent to Earth by his father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) from his dying home world, Krypton, after a simultaneous ecological disaster/military coup dooms the planet. 33 years later, the boy has grown up to become Clark Kent, a drifter and outcast who has enormous super powers that he does not understand and, occasionally, cannot control. However, things change when Zod (Michael Shannon), the Kryptonian General who led the coup, returns from exile and threatens the people of Earth unless the son of Jor-El reveals himself to them. Aided by tenacious journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and members of a distrusting US military, Clark must accept his identity and make a difficult choice: whether to aid Zod in his quest to find a new home world for what remains of the population of Krypton, or save his adopted planet from a terrible fate.\n\nMan of Steel does ask some interesting questions about identity and heritage, and the nature of super powers and what the discovery of their existence would mean in a real-world sense, which are explored mainly though the flashback sequences involving Diane Lane and an unexpectedly outstanding Kevin Costner as Clark's parents. However, this more cerebral approach is wholly abandoned in the film's second half, which quickly disintegrates into a series of seemingly endless fight sequences between CGI super heroes, during which people are constantly thrown through buildings, demolishing huge swathes of cities, killing thousands, and which are as boring as they are repetitive. The design and CGI effects are astonishingly good, but this cannot overcome the film's massive shortcomings, a great deal of which are to do with the moral ambiguity shown by several of the lead characters, and the almost complete absence of any semblance of fun or humor. This Superman is grim, deadly serious, and at times quite brutal, and for me represents an astonishing miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers in terms of what Superman is, and what he represents.\n\nClearly, this new-style Superman is mirrored by its score, which is generally as grim, serious and brutal as the film itself. I suppose, in one respect, Zimmer has to score the film he is given. This is not the Superman of your father, with Christopher Reeve wearing the red cape, Richard Donner filming the action and John Williams wielding the baton, and that has to be acknowledged. In fact, probably the biggest thing that Man of Steel has going for it is the fact that it sounds nothing like the 1978 Superman score, and has no trace of John Williams's classic theme. Trying to fit the square peg of Williams's heroic, patriotic Americana march into this film's round hole would have been absolutely the wrong approach, and one has to at least admire the fact that Zimmer tried to come up with a brand new way of scoring the character. However, having said that, the music and the film are inseparable, and for me the music mirrors the problems that film has. Not only that, the score is irredeemably simple from a purely compositional standpoint, and has so little emotional content that it barely connects with its audience.\n\nZimmer has said in interviews (and I'm paraphrasing here) that he wanted his music to capture the essence of middle America; the simplicity of life in Kansas, the white picket fences and the uncomplicated family oriented folk that Superman grew up amongst, and lives to protect. I can absolutely understand that approach, and in many ways it's a good one, but the problem comes through the fact that Zimmer has taken the essence of Superman and stripped it down so far, made it so simple and uncomplicated, that it's wholly unfulfilling, on both emotional and musical terms. Zimmer's theme for Superman is a two-note ascending motif (which reminds me of the first two notes of Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man - possibly intentional?), and it's all over the score, but for the vast majority of the score's running time it is left in such an undeveloped state that it's almost impossible to connect with. I have no problem with simplicity in itself; the most simple musical phrases can be perfect and beautiful, and have been on many occasions, but for film music to work there still has to be an emotional connection between composer, film and audience, and for me a theme with such brevity and so little growth offers me nothing to latch onto.\n\nThis economy of emotion has become a running trend in Zimmer's work over the last couple of years, a sort of Zimmer minimalism which takes tiny fragments of a phrase and repeats them over and over, the prime examples being Batman's theme in Batman Begins, the Joker's theme in The Dark Knight, as well as large parts of Inception. Zimmer's enormous influence in this regard has seen this style spill over into other films by other composers, resulting in a film music trend, in Hollywood at least, that celebrates a lack of emotional content and strong, memorable themes as showing maturity and not spoon-feeding an audience in terms of what they are supposed to think and feel. As someone who grew up listening to and loving the work of Williams and Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner and John Barry, and many others, this attitude is the absolute antithesis of what I feel film music should aspire to be, and when the most successful films in Hollywood each year are usually scored by Zimmer, someone who currently works for or with Zimmer, or someone who used to work for Zimmer, it pains me because I can't see an end to the cycle. The more successful the film is, the more the studios will want to emulate the sound that film has, the more composers will be asked to sound like Zimmer, and so on and so on.\n\nBut, back to Man of Steel. The main two-note theme is heard frequently throughout the score - it's virtually the first thing you hear, in \"Look to the Stars\", for tuned timpanis and bass guitar - and it's pleasant enough, but it simply never goes anywhere. It sounds the same at the beginning of the movie as it does in the middle of the movie as it does at the end of the movie, giving the whole score a sense of stagnancy. The only real changes it undergoes are in orchestration, or in key. It reappears in \"Sent Here For a Reason\" on a solo piano, the first of several statements in this manner, which usually accompany a Clark Kent Kansas childhood flashback sequence, and are actually quite pretty. The very end of \"Tornado\" and \"This is Clark Kent\" feature similar performances, but when the lead instrument for the motif switches to electric guitar, the music becomes heavily reminiscent of Zimmer's 1995 score Broken Arrow, albeit without Duane Eddy's spirited performances bringing a spark to the proceedings. It all sounds very much like an oddly unfinished chord, the base of a piece of music to which someone forgot to add the interesting thematic layer. It just sits there, listlessly, providing a texture, but not much else.\n\nThe tension/drama music which typifies cues such as \"DNA\" and \"Launch\" employs the same basic rhythmic cello ostinatos that dominated The Dark Knight, Inception, The Da Vinci Code, and dozens of other scores by other composers, a clich that has become tiresome over the last few years. The action music, in cues such as \"Oil Rig\", \"Tornado\", \"You Die or I Do\" and \"Ignition\", is actually quite obnoxious, featuring a gang of \"celebrity drummers\" bashing away on a number of enormous drums for anywhere between thirty seconds and three minutes, accompanied by Mel Wesson's patented electronic sound design washes, and an occasional interlude by a huge bank of horns all playing the same note simultaneously, over and over.\n\nThe 9-minute \"Terraforming\" is perhaps the nadir of all this, with endlessly repeated percussion loops and blasting brass whole notes that are gradually joined by squealing, grating electronic \"enhancements\" that actually cause distortion in the speakers at their higher registers, such is their hideousness. One can only imagine that Zimmer took a listen to the eardrum-pummeling sampled MRI machine that Steve Jablonsky used in Battleship and wanted to top it in terms of headache-inducing chaos. Worse still, some of the percussion rhythms actually seem to be quite badly executed, never coming together as a coherent pattern. It's just messy and noisy, and poor from a purely compositional standpoint. Zimmer's action music used to be so rich, so powerful, so full of life and energy, that it makes you desperately nostalgic for scores like The Peacemaker, or Drop Zone, or Point of No Return, which were chock-full of interesting rhythmic ideas and clever touches in terms of pacing and tempo.\n\nEvery now and again, a piece of music does pique the interest briefly, reminding the listener what a good composer Zimmer can be when he wants to be. The middle section of \"Krypton's Last\" has an unexpectedly beautiful violin solo that is quite touching. Similarly, parts of \"I Have So Many Questions\" feature a solo cello and wordless vocal combination that is very soothing. The vocally-inflected \"Goodbye My Son\", as well as the last minute or so of the aforementioned \"Terraforming\", has a quite nice timbre to it that reminds me of the processed vocal work in The Peacemaker back in 1997, but this brief nostalgic flashback only raises the interest briefly, before it's back to the familiar sound of churning cellos, electric guitars, and rock percussion.\n\nTo give the score its fair dues, the score does contain two fairly good cues: the conclusive pair, \"Flight\" and \"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\". Here, and only here, does Zimmer's two note theme show any sign of development of heroic intent. \"Flight\" is out of order (the cue actually occurs about half way through the film, when Clark accepts his identity and learns to fly for the first time), but does have a sense of grandeur to it that is quite welcome, although the electric guitar chords are a little grating at times. \"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\" is, by a long margin, the best cue on the album, for the one simple reason that Zimmer finally allows his two-note theme a little room to breathe and grow, building over the course of five and a half minutes with increasingly optimistic progressions, until it finally emerges into the one, true, heroic anthemic statement of hope and glory in the entire score. However, these two halfway decent cues come too little too late, and are not enough to salvage the rest of the score from its pit of disappointment.\n\nThe score concludes with a gargantuan 28-minute piece called \"Man of Steel (Hans' Original Sketchbook)\", the original suite of music which Zimmer wrote on his computer outlining his thematic ideas and textural choices, and from which his team of composers, arrangers and orchestrators formed the actual meat of the score. It's interesting that Zimmer would actually include this sketchbook cue on the album, as in the past Zimmer has been somewhat reluctant to admit that he actually works this way, but you can certainly hear the genesis of all the ideas in this piece. I do wonder just who will listen to this cue more than once, however, considering that it is essentially little more than a synth mockup of the score without any context, cue breaks, or live instruments.\n\nThis review is of the standard release of the score; a longer \"special edition\" of the score also exists, which comes presented in a natty metallic box, and features six additional cues - \"Are You Listening, Clark?\", \"General Zod\", \"You Led Us Here\", \"This is Madness!\", \"Earth\" and \"Arcade\", four of which feature additional music by the Dutch composer/musician Tom Holkenborg AKA Junkie XL. These cues present, by and large, more of the same, except that the electronic/synthetic element is much more prominent in Holkenborg's cues.\n\nSo, here's the bottom line. I understand that Man of Steel is a different film than the original Superman and its sequels, and as much as I dislike the changes made to the nature of Superman, and as much as I feel that these changes represent a gross miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers, I acknowledge that these changes were made, and that as a result Zimmer's score had to change too. A John Williams-style score would not have been appropriate for this film, and so the fact that Zimmer chose to go in a different direction was entirely the right decision. What disappoints me more than anything is the lack of emotional content resulting from the decision to strip down the thematic content to its absolute bare bones, as well as the apparent lack of ambition inherent in the failure to create a new and interesting sonic world for Superman to inhabit. Superman is THE iconic American super-hero, a beacon of light and hope and justice for the world. For him to be saddled with witless percussion, such predictable string writing, and such a simplistic and repetitive thematic statement is disappointing in the extreme.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 1.81}, {"id": "21642", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Jo has never really been shown any love or affection and really doesn't have anyone in her life, until Puerto Rico, Jo thinks this is a great way to be as she can't get hurt.\nWhat Jo doesn't see coming Is how much she will change on this trip.\n\nAdam is a guy hung up on an Ex, he is on the trip to further his future career but he is also clued to his phone waiting for his ex Shannon to call.\nWhen Adam meets Jo for the first he is literally floored, but even with a bruise pride he really sees beyond her hard edges and finds the real Jo that even she doesn't know exsists.\n\nThis is definitely not a smith ride for either of these two love birds, Jo fights her feelings every step of the way and Adam also has to let go of Shannon's hold over him.\n\nThis is a beautifully written love story about so much more, it reaches into you and makes you root for the vulnerable woman behind the disguise, it teaches us friendships can be unexpected and some people are just meant to be.\n\nI loved Adam and Jos story and highly recommend this book.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "21660", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Is it really a nonfiction book if the author doesn't even know whether or not the events included therein actually happened? Reading chapter after chapter of this unique tome convinced me that what matters more than the label is the entertaining and highly compelling mix of anecdotes included between its covers... that their veracity, though completely in question, isn't really the point.\n\nAnother interesting dimension of Liar, at least for me, is that Roberge has led a life very different than that of my own. I can report with 100% surety the month and year of the only concussion I've knowingly sustained. I've never used illegal drugs. I've gotten drunk fewer times than fingers on my left hand. The one instance when I abused prescription medication involved taking a second dose of my own post-surgery Vicodin 30 minutes before it was due. So, reading the memoir of someone who has seemingly sniffed, snorted, swallowed, and shot up every substance a human can conceivably ingest was an interesting chance to walk in someone else's (very different) shoes for a couple of hours. It was also a window into the mind of an addict, and reading Liar was a far removed way for me to confront my own issues with those I love and have loved who can be identified by that label.\n\nMostly, Liar is an adept illustration of one fact: whether or not a story is true is secondary to how much verisimilitude it has. Roberge is an artful enough storyteller that he is able to imbue possibly true and even maybe outright untrue stories with a feeling of truth, which makes Liar a good read.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "21661", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

But didn't quite live up to the hype for me.  It literally read like a screenplay to me.  Very simplistic writing, unimpressive science, and meh dialogue.  Shallow, cliche characterizations... didn't much care for the protag.  He's supposedly a true genius but is really a crybaby idiot through most of the story with very poor judgement!  However, the story IS designed to take you on a plot-driven thrill ride (fast-paced, present tense, first person HEY, YOU ARE THE PROTAG!! mechanics in a crazy-cool world)... and I believe that is its greatest strength as a book.\n\nDownloading the audio kind of saved the story for me.  I was too distracted observing the present tense first person YA-style Hello! I'm a screenwriter and this is my next TV show writing, but then it did its job to suck me in once I heard the voice.  The narrator brought extra helpings of urgency and intensity to this story that appealed to my ear... and took my mind off those sentences.\n\nAnd still I think I woulda enjoyed it more as a Netflix mini-series.  Probably because it does feel more like a movie than literature.  Highly derivative material to boot.  It's The Family Man meets Sliders... and a smattering of other time travel, multiverse plotlines you'll feel like you heard before.  Somehow more thriller than sci-fi.  You might even call this a dude's idea of romance.  Meaning, it's very dude-centered and there is a love story here but all the women here exist just to move the plot along.  It's fast and full of action... all about finding his way home to his two-dimensional wife and one-dimensional son (who you'll forget even exists).\n\nNot saying it wasn't kinda fun-- it did have its good parts and I enjoy well-done time travel/multiverse type stories in general... but much of it was very predictable for me (maybe I've read/seen too many) and I could see it was a complete patchwork of stolen goods done better elsewhere... desperately seeking (another) TV show.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "21662", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

They along with the FBI, Secret Service and other police departments have been investigating and trying to arrest a woman named Mitzi Vandlo following her all over the country.  She along with her adult son Stefan is wanted for fraud, financial crimes and violence.  Someone has spotted Stefan living undercover in Edilean, Virginia and he is engaged to marry a hometown girl by the name of Sara Shaw.\n\nThe Captain wants Mike to go investigate, stop the marriage, protect Ms. Shaw and hopefully finally arrest Mitzi Vandlo. While Mike has never been to Edilean, his sister Tess lives there and is currently in Europe on her honeymoon.  Mike lets Tess in on what's happening and gets her to extend her and Ramsey's honeymoon both to keep Tess safe and to give Mike and opening with Sara who happens to be Tess' best friend.\n\nThis story unfold in some rather obvious ways and few surprises.  The interactions between Sara and Mike are good but Sara's inability to see her fiance Greg (aka Stefan) for what he is when her family, best friends and, in fact, the whole town don't like him seems beyond stubborn.\n\nEntertaining to read but not one of her best.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "21663", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Here are a few reasons why I didn't push through to the end..\n\n* I am familiar with Monica McInerney's writing style - but based on synopsis, was willing to give her another try\n* Slow start due to multiple background depicts/set up of multiple characters mundane life details\n* Tedious, every day reality.  A dull, daily life voyeurism.\n* Basically the same premise, different house\n* The boring side of the human condition\n\ni read McInerney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/At-Home-with-the-Templetons/dp/B006O8T9BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">At Home with the Templetons</a>&nbsp;and had a similar experience.  So why try another novel by the author?  Well, I read the synopsis and thought perhaps I might like this book more than the previous one I read by the author.  You never know, it could be and should be different, right? Why not give her a second try?\n\nHowever, this was much of the same.  A slow start that involves multiple mundane details about a variety of characters and their daily life, which leads them to gathering at the same place, a B&B.  Yes, this could be an interesting premise, but McInerney rather focus on less than intriguing details that bond people, rather than weave an interesting complexity.  Sure, I can appreciate the true to life approach - but, it doesn't necessarily make for interesting or entertaining reading.\n\nI suppose this ultimately comes down to why the reader is reading a book in the first place.  What do you wish to get out of it?  For me, it's not simply to get a glimpse into another way of life (despite the details), but to find a connection and be entertained.  Although, I could connect with the characters, their lives did not entertain in a way of escaping from my own ordinary life.  Even though these people gather, not much happens beside introspective reflection and general analyzing of the human condition.\n\nNow, if you enjoy pondering the more mundane aspects of the human condition, you'll probably like McInerney's writing style and novel premise.  It just doesn't appeal to me.  I can appreciate it, but rather not invest too much of my reading time taking this journey.  Since I already gave full attention to a previous novel by this author, once I saw this was more of the same (with different gathering characters), I determined to put it aside.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21666", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

There were quite a few disaffected outsiders that seemed to have figured out that the revolution was not destined to last, that it was in fact quickly becoming a sham. As corporate America began to swallow and repackage the 60's, some of the folks left behind by the peace and love generation began to vent their anger and shape a new vision. Proto-punk bands like the MC5 and The Stooges started to build upon the foundation that had been laid by the Velvet Underground. Their music was raw and violent in it's presentation, sonically threadbare and unpretentious. By the mid-1970's, a true scene began to happen in New York City that would serve to galvanize and give a true voice to this disaffected generation, a scene that would take it's cues directly from the violent and sleazy underground that it dwelled in.\n\nCo-author Legs McNeil was a founding member of the seminal fanzine that helped give the nascent scene it's name and identity. \"Punk\" magazine was truly a groundbreaker, giving vital press to bands who would have otherwise gotten precious little exposure in the mainstream rock fanzines. Punk, of course, was much more than just a musical movement. In fact, the original punks were much more about living the lifestyle, living the nihilism that permeated their everyday lives. The music was just a conduit through which they expressed their dissatisfaction and aggression, it reflected what they were actually experiencing on the street.\n\n\"Please Kill Me\" covers New York punk from it's birth in the mid-60's at Andy Warhol's Factory all the way to it's eventual death in the late-70's, as corporate America once again begins to catch the wave and numerous members of the original first wave of punk begin to burn out from the excessive and dangerous lifestyles that they embraced. McNeil and co-author Gillian McCain present their material in the form of interviews with a vast number of the people who were there on the front lines, experiencing and inventing the punk scene as it developed. Johnny Thunders, Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, The Ramones, Richard Hell, Danny Fields....they are all heard from here along with a host of groupies, drug dealers, hookers, agents and managers, club owners, and other scene hangers-on.\n\nOverall, it's a great book, and the interview format really works well. The book is worth it's price just on the strength of the Iggy stories alone, but there's a ton of great source material here covering a lot of ground. it's a weighty tome at 500+ pages, but it reads fast and the stories never drag. I might have wished for a slightly larger photo section, but that's a minor gripe at best.\n\nReaders must make note that this book covers primarily the development of 1970's-era New York punk, with a side detour to England to witness the birth of the Sex Pistols and British punk. (Though the Stooges and the MC5 are profiled extensively, giving voice to the seminal Detriot scene.)\n\nPunk did indeed die at the end of the 70's, and it has of course been resurrected and reinvented by succeeding generations. But if you want to know where the whole thing began, you have to get this book.\n\nHIGHLY recommended!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "21694", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It deals with a deeply flawed but brilliant man who makes the mistake of beginning to care about people, which, in a sense, could become his redemption. But we don't really know. The movie is wonderfully enigmatic, understated, documentary-like at times. You have to listen carefully and to think; Coppola resists hitting you over the head to make a point. Gene Hackman in his greatest role, by far. The late John Cazale in a typically riveting performance (how's that for a filmography for John C: The Deerhunter, The Godfather Saga, Dog Day Afternoon, The Conversation: not too shabby, eh?)! The great Alan Garfield (now Gurwitz) as the \"best bugger on the east coast\". Robert Duvall as the auto exec, with his creepy aide, Harrison Ford.\nI won't attempt to summarize the film; I wouldn't do it justice.

Jack Goodwin is an Irish American who served with the OSS during WW 2. One of the missions he went on would prove to be the greatest and worst wrapped all together. Flying over Poland, Jack and his crew begin to take heavy anti-aircraft fire as well as come under attack from enemy planes. Though they fought back, Jack and his crew are shot down. After crashing, Jack is stumbling through the unknown in Poland when a biplane crashes nearby. Jack saves the pilot, only to discover that this pilot is Veronika, a beautiful Soviet who is not only dropping bombs on the Germans but also running from her life in Russia. The two strike up an unlikely friendship and a romance even begins to blossom until a pack of hungry wolves attack them. Jack defends them and kills the alpha wolf, but the gunshot alerts of searching German patrols to their location and the pair is soon captured. From here, the pair is interrogated, separated, and then have to do the unthinkable against a terrifying enemy in order to find one another again and survive to the end of the war.\nI really enjoyed this read. Jack is an awesome character. He is full of heart and very real. I also like that the author decided to have the story told by Jack to his daughter once she is a teenager. By doing this, the author makes it as if we are the daughter learning about the things our father and mother went through during the war. Veronika is also completely held in mystery the entire time. We know that she has to play a vital part in Jack's story, but we are unclear of what she is to him until much later in the book. This is good because it keeps the reader interested the entire time. I think that fans of wartime fiction will really enjoy this because it is a unique story that stays true to the history and events of the time. It is very well written and the author has done a fantastic job with the editing.

The surprise here is that Roxy Music is playing with the enthusiasm of a brand new band with something to prove. Features songs from their entire career with a decided focus on the first four albums. Set list: Virginia Plain, Ladytron, Re-make Re-model, For Your Pleasure, In Every Dream Home a Heartache, Editions of You, Street Life, Mother of Pearl, A Song for Europe, Out of the Blue, Love is the Drug, Both Ends Burning, Oh Yeah, My Only Love, Dance Away, Avalon, Tara, While My Heart is Still Beating, Jealous Guy.\n\n2004 THE HIGH ROAD(***** Five Stars): Concert DVD of Roxy Music's 1982-83 Avalon-era tour. Features songs from their entire career but with a decided focus on the romantic swooning sounds of the Avalon (LP) and High Road(EP) songs. This is a real crowd pleaser for fans of the late seventies and early eighties smoother Roxy sound. This DVD is sometimes maligned for being a too polished affair but this features Roxy's musicianship, if not its avant-garde edginess, at its best. You can hear the entire set list if you purchase the Frejus Live CD (which includes more songs and more of the extended jams from this same tour).\n\n2005 ROXY MUSIC/T.REX LIVE (***** Five Stars): Features INCREDIBLE Live performances of six Roxy Music songs from the German TV show Musikladen. Five of the songs are taken from their first 1973 appearance on the show: (a low energy) Do The Strand, (a rollicking) Editions of You (with a very energetic neo-crypto anarcho primitivist Eno playing analog synth on the left & debonaire rock sophisticate Ferry organ on the right side of the stage), (Ferry goes into a trance to sing) In Every Dream Home a Heartache (and Manzanera finishes the song with a blistering guitar line), Re-Make Re-Model (features Mackay's considerable talents with sax and other wind instruments), & (the set closes out with) Virginia Plain. And then (for some inexplicable reason) a perfomance of All I Want is You, taken from a 1974 appearance on the show. Highlights: *OUTRAGEOUS OUTFITS! Brian Eno wearing his infamous peacock feathers while noodling around with his keyboards, synthesizers and tape machines. Manzanera, in an equally outrageous costume, is a revelation on guitar. Mackay is wearing green satin martian pants and huge silver platform shoes, during Re-Make Re-Model he turns his sax upside down and jams some crazy note out of that thing. Ferry wears a white tux, that is until Virginia Plain when he wears a black glittery jacket.*\nPlus five T.Rex songs (which look like the kind of videos you see on VH-1 classic rock, ie it looks like the band is performing inside a swirling psychedelic kaliedoscope): Jeepster, Life's a Gas, Ride a White Swan, Jewel, Twentieth Century Boy.  If you're an Eno fan (and a T.Rex fan) this is the e- ticket!!!!!(Upside: This is usually available for about $5-$10 dollars).\n\n2005 MUSIKLADEN (***** Five Stars): This disc features all of the songs played on Roxy Music's four Musikladen appearances. So it includes all of the performances mentioned above plus: Pyjamarama, Amazona, Mother of Pearl, Psalm, Street Life, Out of the Blue (featuring Eddie Jobson on electric violin), If It Takes All Night, Over You & Oh Yeah (the latter two are lip-synched). Highlight: Jobson on electric violin! (Downside: at $30.00, its expensive).\n\n2006 THRILL OF IT ALL (***** Five Stars): This is a compilation of Live performances (from the Siren & Avalon eras), tv appearances, videos & promos. Ok, post-1975 Roxy is not as good as the pre-1975 Roxy, but its still Roxy Music.

Her books tend to skate the thin line of dark yet the love story within the plot seems to lighten the load.  Perfect Rage is Connor's story and with the tragic backstory of this character, I couldn't wait to see how she'd pull off such a painfully flawed character, that despite being a true hero, was held captive, drugged and turned until a cold-hearted anti-hero. Should I love him or hate him for the things he did to our beloved characters in Perfect Ruin?  I knew somehow this author would bring him back in my good graces but his road to recovery would be long and hard fought.\n\nWe've followed Connor O'Neill through all the Unyielding series books. Brother to Georgie in Perfect Chaos, army hero until he was captured by a Columbian drug lord and used for an experimental drug to take good men and make them into cold hearted killers.  Does he have a chance for mental rehabilitation after doing such horrible things? Can he live with himself and the long-term side effects of the drug he was given in captivity? Is there a chance for second chances with the deal changer for him all those years ago in the army, a woman named Catalina?\n\nPerfect Rage was not an easy second-chance romance. Nashoda Rose did not go easy on Connor and his road to recovery and my heart broke for the man he'd become. The broken man that had so much taken away, had done so much under the influence of the drug. Regret. Guilt. Rage so deep within, it was palpable- like a brewing storm just waiting to erupt. I wanted to reach into my little kindle and hug the pain, the headaches, away from him.\n\nPreviously meeting Catalina Moreno in Perfect Ruin, I didn't form much of an opinion of her until reading this book- her story.  She too is a victim of the drug-lord Carlos Moreno yet she chose to fight to get her life back, fought tooth and nail to get her lover back she lost so many years ago. But is Connor the man she met and fell for over a decade ago or is he long gone, a victim of Vault and all their doings?\n\nNashoda Rose added so much to this book beyond just the Connor/Alina story. We got to see quite a bit of Deck/Georgie and Kai/London- the Unyielding crew. It's a battle well fought and I genuinely worried how she would pull off his rehabilitation and make it realistic but she did! Now I'd like to place an order for a certain man-whore character named Deaglan!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21725", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It is an iPod dock that can be powered by a VERY large power brick, or 8xAA batteries.  It has a smalish remote which allows you to make selections on the iPod, pause/play, next/prev track, mute, vol up/down, bass boost and ROTATE.  The round grey button for Menu/up/down/ok needs to be pushed quite hard.  The center of the circle does nothing.  It is not a button.  Strange.  Why not make that \"OK\"?  Probably would infringe on an Apple patent or something.\n\nThe Rotate feature is why you would buy this instead of the litany of other iPod docks.  Push a button on the remote and the iPod turns 90 degrees counter-clockwise so you can watch a video in widescreen (if you have one of those iPods.)  This is kind of a cool gimmicky feature.  A button on the top turns off a backlight (the blue ring).  When on, the blue ring changes color when you rotate (to a lighter blue).\n\nThe sound quality on this is its largest flaw.  In a word, terrible.  You don't need to be much of a critic to know the sound is poor.  It reminds me of a transistor radio speaker from the 80s.  I'm pretty sure I can hear stereo sound.\n\nThe iPod connector also charges your iPod and there is a mini-plug in the back for a line-in (if you aren't using an actual ipod.)\n\nIt comes with a bunch of filler plates so all manner of iPods (with a standard iPod connector) will fit in the rotating mechanism.\n\nI want to give it four stars, but the sound quality is so bad and the power brick is so large I can only justify three.  Oh, I almost forgot, you cannot use any type of iPod case with this thing - not even a super thin silicone case.  That settles it.

Kate Wicker addresses this question and other popular myths about motherhood in her latest book.  Ive often felt as though Im missing out because we don't have children of our own.  Ive also felt as though I should be closer to perfect as a caregiver, nanny, and/or teacher because Im not on the job 24/7 like parents are.\n\nEach chapter starts out with a catchy title followed by two statements: the first is a myth about motherhood referred to as an Evil Earworm, and the second is called Unvarnished Truth.  The premise of the book is expressed succinctly on page 1:\nEvil Earworm\nBeing a mother is the most important thing a Catholic woman can do.\n\nUnvarnished Truth\nMotherhood is not your highest calling.  Being a daughter of God is.\n\nWow!  What a great reminder!  I love children and have very much enjoyed being part of the village to help raise some of them.  There have certainly been times when I have put my job/vocation of taking care of and teaching other peoples children above my role as daughter of God and wife.  Even without our own kids, Ive fallen into the trap of getting wrapped up in the little people in my care to the exclusion of some of the other priorities I ought to have.\n\nMy view that I should be able to reach something closer to perfection when taking care of or teaching children because Im not on call 24/7 is pretty skewed.  Ive been reminded of how impossible this is numerous times over the past several years, yet part of me still believes that I should strive for perfection instead of excellence.  Clearly, Kate Wicker is a kindred spirit who has struggled with similar notions regarding motherhood.\n\nWhether you are biologically and/or legally responsible for the children in your care 24/7 or for a limited period of time each weekday, the truth is youll make some mistakes.  Despite your best intentions, past experiences, whatever reading you have done or on-the-job training youve completed, there will be times when youll not be as patient, pleasant, or compassionate as you are able to be.  A woman can strive to do her best to be kind, gentle, and loving with children in her care, but sometimes she will fail miserably to be any one of those things.  That doesnt mean she is a failure as a caregiver, nanny, or as a mother.  It means shes human.\n\nWhether you have half a dozen children of your own or provide daytime childcare for one infant, your physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual strength and endurance will be tried.  There will be precious moments and warm memories to melt your heart, and there will be others that are nothing short of exasperating and heart-wrenching.\n\nGetting Past Perfect illustrates how it is possible to be a woman grounded in prayer, lifted up in love, realistic when it comes to the importance of her vocations as wife and mother, as well as honest when taking care of little people has brought her to her knees in tears.\n\nWhen people tell you to enjoy every minute of motherhood, its okay to look at them like they're crazy.  When you're in the middle of the grocery store with a preschooler who insists on pushing the cart, a toddler whos stripping in public, and an infant with poop oozing out one side of his diaper, you can be honest and loathe that moment of motherhood without being thought of as some ungrateful wretch who doesnt deserve children.\n\nIn addition to denying the ability to be perfect, Kate Wicker reminds readers that no matter how much we love the children God has placed in our arms and on our hearts, He loves them infinitely more.  When we are facing circumstances outside of our control, the best thing we can do is offer the precious lives in our care for a time back to the Lord God who created them.\n\nRaising children doesnt have to be a blessing or a cross that you bear on your own.  You can share it with your husband, family, friends, and community.  Most importantly, you can share the responsibility of saying and doing whats best with God.\n\nI highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Getting-Past-Perfect-How-to-Find-Joy-and-Grace-in-the-Messiness-of-Motherhood-A-Catholicmom-Com-Book/dp/1594717168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Getting Past Perfect: How to Find Joy and Grace in the Messiness of Motherhood (A Catholicmom.

I was very curious at this point as there was no reason that this should not perform at least as well as other devices have plugged into the same 19 pin header.  Additional testing shows that indeed, this device does perform above USB 2.0 speeds for the USB ports.  However, the card reader is definitely USB 2.0 and the USB-C port labelled as USB 3.1 is truly a USB 3.0 port with the USB C form factor.\n\nThe issue was an add in USB 3.0 PCIe card that I had bought to add an extra 19-pin header for this device.  In my testing however, I had directly connected the device to the motherboard 19pin, so I did not suspect this PCIe card as being the problem.  However, it seems it was creating some angst on my PCIe bus which resulted in decreased performance of even my onboard USB.  Removing that USB card allowed this USB hub to perform inline with expectations.\n\nI have added a star, though I still see the false advertising as unforgivable given that the card reader is USB 2.0.\n\nUpdate 2017-08-11 After Mfg Comment\n\nAfter the comments by the mfg, I did further investigation.  I have attached photos to support that investigation.  This investigation verified my assertion that the card reader portion of this device is __not__ USB 3.0 but rather is a USB 2.0 device.  The card reader is supported by the Ascore AU6477DL, a USB 2.0 card reader chip, it is not capable of reading moder SD Cards at full speed.\n\nOn the other hand, the USB ports seem to be in order, with the exception of the port labelled USB3.1, which is a USB C 3.0 port.  The USB C connector does not make the port USB 3.1.  The first USB 3.0 port is a direct pass thru from the 19 pin header, and should have no issues.  I will do some additional testing to see if this proves true.  The other USB ports including the USB-C port are connected to an internal USB 3.0 Hub supported by a VIA VL813, a legitimate USB 3.0 hub chip.  There is no explanation for the low performance that I saw.  I will do additional testing.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nI wanted to like this.  I needed it to work well, it is a flop.  I have always seen Kingwin as an excellent brand, albeit a bit overpriced.  At this point I didn't care.  I am desperate for a high quality high performance card reader insert.  This is not it.\n\nImmediately my hopes were shattered after examining it out of the box. There were 3 connectors, a 19pin for the USB3.0 and USBc ports.  A Sata connector for the eSata port and a USB2.0 header for the card reader.  Yes a USB2 header connector for the card reader ports meaning that performance of the card reader maxes out at USB 2.0 speeds 480 Mbps or 60 MB/s.  I thought hmph.. well ok at least I will go from 2 front facing USB3.0 to 3 + a USB C style USB 3 port.  So I installed anyhow and booted up and started to benchmark some SD cards, the main reason I need the card reader.  I knew that using the card reader was pointless so I stuck with my Saitec USB3 reader and started running tests.  The Saitec plugged into one of the previous 2 USB 3.0 ports, plugged into the same 19 pin motherboard header has no problem sustaining 90MB/s reads and writes on quality SD cards.  So I connected the Saitec and ran a benchmark on what should have been a very fast card, and it capped around 40MB/s.  I tried three other cards, with the same results.  I tried the same cards in a HooToo USB C reader plugged into the USB C port and again the same results.\n\nI purchased a PCIe card with a 19pin header to work with this.  Unfortunately my computer doesn't seem willing to take another PCIe card, but if you need one this looks like a good option.\nhttp://amzn.to/2wIEzsd\n\nI do recommend this Saitec USB 3.0 reader though, it has worked very well for all but the most cutting edge SD cards.\nhttp://amzn.to/2vjHXvE\n\nConclusion.  The  card reader will only connect to a USB 2.0 header.  The USB 3.0 ports seem to be managed by a USB 2.0 hub.  All in all this was a waste.  I'll have to try again.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.79}, {"id": "21750", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

When Anita's police consultation work interrupts the animator business, her boss hires a powerful, fresh-faced, ignorant kid to pick up the slack.  He's a wanna-be vampire slayer, and Anita takes him under her wing, like a puppy who needs protecting.  A bunch of powerful new vampires show up, all eager to take Jean-Claude down, and since Anita is one of the few humans who knows his identity, she becomes everyone's favorite target.\n\nThere actually wasn't much plot to this one.  Bad vampires want to take control away from Jean-Claude, and Anita gets caught in the middle.  That pretty much sums it up.  The plot may be shallow, but the action was so hot that my eyeballs feel dry from reading it nonstop.  I just couldn't read it fast enough during those life or death scenes; I must have flown through the pages at lightening speed.  I'm not sure how this novel would stand up to repeated readings, but it's a fantastic fantasy thriller the first time around.\n\nThere was some progress made between Anita and Jean-Claude.  I'm not sure where this twisted relationship is headed, but it's far from dull.  I happened to be in the library today, and a lady was sitting on the floor directly in front of the shelf that holds all of Ms. Hamilton's books.  She told me these were the best vampire books ever, and I could tell that she's read them all, but she couldn't stop ogling them.  When I meet fans like this, or maybe I should call them fanatics, I'm inclined to think their fascination stems from Jean-Claude rather than Anita.

While the two books share some similarities I did like Declare better for its grander scale and its tendency to grow on you. Three Days to Never has different strengths. It is more focused and provides a remarkably original treatment of time travel. The definitive time travel story after H G Wells' Time Machine was and remains Isaac Asimov's The End of Eternity (published in 1955). Many science fiction writers have dealt with the inherent paradoxes of time travel including the \"killing your own grandfather\" paradox. Many have paid lip service to Isaac Asimov, some have ignored his fascinating original assertion about the inertia of history, but none has come even close to surpassing him. Here Tim Powers gives us the most original and though-provoking treatment of time travel since Asimov, who I am quite certain he has read and internalized. As expected his blend of science and the supernatural has a completely different flavor from hard science fiction and this particular book is sometimes disorienting (no doubt like being blind but being able to see through the eyes of people nearby, like one of the characters) but it is also smart and provocative.\n\nPowers writes with erudition. There are many references to Shakespeare's Tempest and other literary landmarks. A more subtle touch is a character with the name Lepidopt. Lepidoptera is the order of insects that includes butterflies and no doubt the allusion is to the \"butterfly effect\", which would be pertinent to the story. I did think that involving Einstein was somewhat unnecessary, but on balance there seems no other way to set up the story in quite the same terms. The role of Charlie Chaplin, though, is a stretch.\n\nI first thought the ending, while quite dizzying (like the characters' use of double astral projections), was a little anti-climactic. On reflection I think Powers has got it right and proves himself a very thoughtful writer. The alternatives would inevitably either be inconsistent, or worse, hyped-up versions of exactly the same denouement. This book is a ground-breaking contribution to time travel fiction.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21766", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I had a big pile of them on grilled hamburgers last night!  Awesome!\n\nThese seeds seem to be very high quality.  I've tried some other seeds with middling to poor results.  But these always turn out great.  I love them, and just ordered a big batch of new seeds.\n\nHere's how I grow them.  I bought two plastic shoe boxes from the dollar store, drilled holes in bottom of both for drainage.  I cut a piece of plastic craft/embroidery mesh to fit the bottoms of both boxes.  I put a half cup of seeds in a mason jar, and soak over night.  Then I drain and rinse twice a day for 3-4 more days.  At this point, there is a half inch white shoot coming out of most the seeds.  Then, dump into one shoebox on top of the mesh piece, spread evenly.  The mesh will provide a foothold for the roots.  Place the second box ON TOP of the newly sprouting seeds.  Put a good amount of weight in the top box.  A few cans of corn, a brick, etc.  This will help the sprouts take root, plus build up some strength.  In addition, it will make the sprouts all grow to about the same height, which looks nice and is easier to cut.  After a few days under the weight, the sprouts are greening up and pushing upward, then remove the top box and let them grow a few more days.  During this entire process you should be rinsing and draining your sprouts two to three times daily.  Leaving the top box in place, I run water between the two boxes, which helps the sprouts from moving too much, helping them take root. As your sprouts feel more secure, run you fingers over the tops, under running water to help remove the black shells.  A few stubborn shells will need to be picked off.  You don't want to eat the black shell, or the root portion.  When ready, slice near the bottom.  An advantage of the plastic mesh mat is that you can lift it out of the box to make slicing at the base of the sprouts easier.  I usually cut what I need and keep rinsing to keep them fresh.  But if you cut them all off, they keep pretty well in a plastic bag in the fridge.\n\nAnd if you were REALLY SMART, about half way thru this, you'd have started a second batch, that can go under the box with the other sprouts!  Keep it going!  You won't want to be without these sprouts in your kitchen.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21768", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Her aunts were right. Necromancers were always alone, largely because they were always trying to kill each other. There was no one to trust. Innocents got caught in the cross-fire.

I found in some cases, the mounting screws were not long enough to reach through the lamp base, while in other cases they were too long.

I loved it then, but the years were unkind to my recollection of it, so I wanted to reread it before embarking on the new TV show. Rather than just read it casually, my wife and I decided to read it together, chapter by chapter, and discuss what we had read. So each week, we read, and on Sunday, we re-read out loud the entire chapter, then discussed. This activity opened the secrets of this novel up in ways that I couldn't have imagined. I believe I'll read it every year going forward. Strong prose isn't usually attributed to 'science fiction', but this is extremely well written. Each section is written in a style mimicking the way the characters might talk, whether it be a broken type of English, or otherwise. The characters are multi-dimensional... and you can almost take that literally. The story speaks on authenticity, the human experience's possible meaninglessness, and 'who the hell cares if it's meaningless anyway'. The acknowledgement of nothingness as goal. The high castle might just be a stucco job in Glendale, maybe it's your house. Look at the things you have stacked up everywhere, what do they really mean to  you, and why. Ubik.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this novel and this writer. Hilarious. Thought provoking. Mind boggling. Sometimes downright insane. Psychedelic. Goofy. You've probably loved a movie that this writer inspired. But be warned. Philip K. Dick's works, most that I've read, have a surface, and one can usually glean the surface, enjoy, and move on. Don't be that someone. Dig a little deeper. You won't regret it. Of course, all this began with the TV show. Now I'm terrified to watch it.

I have been intrigued as I watched it reliably deliver a \"dab\" of diswhashing soap countless times a day. My first impression was \"somebody's throwing money away at work\". The design was attractive, and as I used it, I noticed it did not leak. Best of all, it was the perfect way to get soap on very dirty or greasy hands without getting grease or dirt on the soap container.\n\nFinally, I was at home last week, trying to wipe the dripped soap from the regular dispenser off our counter, and said, \"wait a minute, I know a better way,\" and placed an order. Because this thing had held up so well in our office, I had no trepidation about paying the somewhat hefty price. That said, when this arrived, my wife and I had it up and running in five minutes, although I will concede the instructions are \"succinct\". I can see how the priming \"scrap of paper\" could have been missed, but it also seems to be clear in the rest of the packaging what to do.\n\nThis is an attractive and very functional tool and is elegant in design and manufacture. Simplehuman obviously gives great thought to the design and manufacture of their products, and as my wife looked through their catalog, I am reconciled that this will turn out to be more expensive than the purchase price (as my wife identifies other needs).\n\nI believe we will end up saving significant money by not wasting nearly as much dishwashing soap. I find the amount dispensed entirely adequate to cleaning greasy pots and pans, so I'm sure it's fine for ordinary dishes too. I will be washing more dishes by hand now that my wife has noticed the Simplehuman dish draining racks in their catalog.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "21788", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Nor do her secondary characters necessarily suffer in comparison, as everyone you meet in these novels has real depth and makes sense as a human being. Matthews also does something else I like, i.e. she never patronizes her readers. This series is compelling, intelligent, and utterly original.\n\nThe Jurisdiction universe is a vicious, unforgiving place to live, a place where torture is routine and the interplanetary government continues with its slow-motion campaign of genocide against the Nurail. Andrej, in spite of his authoritarian upbringing, has finally come to the realization that he doesn't have to play along with the system any longer. I expect to see him do real damage to Jurisdiction in future books, though we don't quite get to that here. I hope the next book comes out before too much time elapses....\n\nThe only criticism I have of the book is the method used to decide what happens with the Jurisdiction hierarchy now that the First Secretary is dead. There is just no way that the Judges (not to mention the various bureaucracies attached to the Judges) would allow the small group of Bench Specialists to decide their fate, no matter how smart and supposedly disinterested said Specialists may be. Powerful people don't become or remain powerful by handing over their destinies to people they can't control. And this universe is all about control, control, control. Fierce politicking and numerous assassinations, I could have believed.\n\nThat said, this book and this series are still much better than 95% of the science fiction out there right now.

There are so many twists and turns in this book that I feel like I've been on a wild roller coaster ride. Lady Maybe is a book filled with bad choices, betrayal, and treachery. It clearly shows the consequences of these. However, there is also forgiveness and love. The book opens with Lady Marianna Mayfield getting ready to leave Bath for a place unknown to her. Her husband, Sir John, doesn't want anyone to know where they are going, so hopefully her lover, Anthony Fontaine, will not follow. Lady Mayfield's former companion, Hannah Rogers, returns just that day to collect some funds due her (she had left without word several months earlier). Lady Mayfield talks Hannah into traveling with them. Almost to their destination, there is a terrible storm and their coach goes over a cliff into the river. Only two people are saved and both are \"insensible\" for a period of time. They are near enough to Sir John's home to be taken there, where we meet kind Dr. Parrish, his snooty wife, their son Edgar, and the housekeeper, dear Mrs. Turrill (one of my favorite characters).  A little later, add a baby, his depressed wet nurse, and a suspicious solicitor to the mix.\nAnd, is the Lady Mayfield that was saved, the real Lady Mayfield?

How can this be?\n\nCorrupt has all the \"right \" characteristics to pull in the would be reader to read this story... intriguing cover, good ratings, many reviews, fantastic author. Readers know that when Penelope writes a Newish Adult read they will get exactly what they want which includes some smoking hot scenes. The story is filled with an intricate web of assumptions and deceit. The story flows well and no doubt about it , is a page turner. I normally do not care about believability when I read, it's fiction however there were a couple character points I couldn't get past. Most young people at 16 are dumb to a point mix in the fact that Erika is sheltered there are some not so great decisions that would be made. However knowing that and buying into her character development just didn't seem realistic. I mean the empowerment and growth she experiences within the course of 12 hours...meehhhhh is a bit too hard to believe for me. Micheal's \"transformation\" felt the same way but it wasn't as extreme. Evolving/growing over time I get and that was fine but that one night...just felt off.\n\nOne night.... decided so much. I loved this intricate web of deceit. Was it enough to cause such extensive damage? Eventually yes, the author does a fantastic job incorporating the reader in the characters mindset. The whole premise of such young people going through all this and or reacting , playing the way they do in Penelope's stories is one reason why I love her stories. This is not the sticking point with me however the specific character actions and or growth were.\n\nThis is still a 4-4.5 star read meaning I really liked it, I just didn't love it.

But when I saw it sitting on the library shelf I gave in to the BDB pull despite knowing I would likely be disappointed.  Tohr was, after all, one of my favorites.  And ultimately I was not surprised that it contained Ward's latest annoying habit - dedicating half a book to a past couple/character.  UGH.  If John and Xhex were even a remotely believable mated couple than MAYBE it wouldn't be so brain-numbing to read about their melodrama.  However, this was a pairing that never felt genuine in the first place and enforcing unnecessary complications on them in order to pad another's story was annoying, horribly boring and just plain badly done.  And only cemented that they were never a solid pairing.  Very unfortunate decision on Ward's part, yet again.  A lot of her recent books have contained the same writing errors in judgement that can be found here, as well.  The Take Two of Xhex and John aside, Lover Reborn had too great a uniformity between all the characters in the way they speak, think and interact.  Apparently, the BDB lingo extends to even shellans and secondary characters.  Well, excluding the Chosen.  Verily verily.  And what was up with the questions without question marks.  Sorry Ward but you are not good enough to rewrite what proper punctuation is.  And the sudden unimportance of the Lessening Society is strange and doesn't seem to fit with the entire premise of the BDB world.  Just not buying it.\n\nAnd though I'm liking Layla for the first time and am intrigued by the direction her story is taking, I do not like the 'let's get pregnant so we have somebody to love' part.  AHH.  Why, oh why?  I do like Quinn and Blay.  Too bad they can't just have an HEA.  But even though the next book might be about them...Ward will screw it up.  Evidence of this is everywhere.  It seems she can't just write a tight, intense and sensible story anymore.\n\nAnd Tohr?  Well...it could have been worse.  But would have been better if the BDB mansion hadn't already descended to a bad soap opera.  He deserved more.  And more to the point - Autumn/No'one deserved more.  She deserved a true mate.  A bonding scent, possessive, loving Mate.  She got the short straw though and doesn't that seem to make her a perpetuating tragedy?\n\nNow the Band of Bastards is working for me.  But this could just because the BDB has stalled, gotten stale and needs a knew cast of reliable characters.  Maybe, just maybe, focusing outside the BDB mansion will help Ward refocus her writing and storytelling.  Here's hoping....though I sense a Tohr and Autumn Take Two in the future.

The humor in the story was funny and made the movie fun. We both laughed a lot and then cried too, due to the painful situations.

I knew bits and pieces about Louis  XIV and his reign but not much about Athenais, the Shadow Queen as she was known. The title of this book is a bit of a misnomer as it is more about Athenais maidservant, Claudette than about Athenais herself. So if you are looking for a novel about the court of Louis XIV and the machinations of his mistress you will not be fully satisfied with this tale for while it does show some of that it is more focused on Claudette and the theatre life of the times.\n\nI found the book rather fascinating despite the fact that I didn't exactly get what I was promised by the title. I'm fascinated by the theatre and to read about the greats of this time - Moliere, Racine and Corneille - kept me turning the pages. It gave full bodied life to what had before been names on a page to me. The mores of the time were also quite interesting and to read about the battles between the church, the king and the theatre - fascinating. There was an author's note in the back which explained more about the times. I always appreciate such an addition although I'm one to delve into further research anyway.\n\nNeither of the two protagonists is entirely likable but Claudette comes out ahead in that many of her decisions were almost forced upon her by the need to care for her family and societal pressures of the times in which she lived. Athenais has come down through history with many a question swirling about her and this novel does nothing to brighten that reputation.\n\nThe novel reads quickly and delves into the backgrounds of Claudette's parents and brother. Both the gritty side of life in Paris and the court life are written well. The ending was somewhat of a disappoint and a little confusing and abrupt. After so much attention to Claudette's life it seemed to just end with a whimper.\n\n3.5\n\n*I received a free copy for my honest review\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21804", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Definitely recommend.\n\nUpdate:  the last thing I colored was the center flower and I used alcohol markers; while these produced my favorite results, there was some bleed through to the back.

He just wanted to make money. He states the change came over time.\n\nI am not Christian, but I am spiritual. Yet I was not offended or bothered by his religious overtones. After all, he is just stating openly what he calls the passion to his success. How his life and the lessons in his life changed when he did take God into his heart and follow God's path. I feel no reason for me to be closed minded to his writing as I truly respect the man and the good he has done. Maybe, just maybe I can be even more open minded to see if his path can also be my path.\n\nI think an important point in the book for me was when he stated all the big important people that helped to form this country (Washington, Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson...) and how these people and our country were built on religious standards and helped to create these great people. But as education is taught less and less from religious and moral influence (for 200 years the alphabet was taught with each letter  referencing a biblical verse and moral standard) the country has produced less and less great leaders that compare to our founding fathers. So maybe Zig has a point about incorporating a better than good life with some religious/spiritual overtones.\n\nFinally something that really stands out for me is realizing how I and so many others who are famous (no, I am not famous) would probably change their actions if they started looking at how they are moral role-models to so many young kids and they are helping to shape the future due to their actions. I know for me I am beginning to rethink what I do and how I do it and how I might be able to help shape the future leaders with my calling.\n\nWell, just my two cents.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21831", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I swapped out an old ceramic sink with a stainless steel and my badger 1 disposal with this one.  Even with sink types considered, since ceramic sinks usually dampen sound better than SS, this disposal is quiter than the old junky, defective badger 1.  I've had no problem with jams, or power of this disposal.  It's handled everything we've dumped in it without issue.  The EZ Mount system is very easy to install and since I put this on a stainless steel sink I didn't need plumber's putty.  The rubber gasket was all that was needed.\n\nThe one thing I do want to mention is that this disposal does come with a 3 prong plug, so if your previous disposal is direct wired, you will either need to wire this up to the existing wire by removing the plug or by dropping an outlet in the wall under the sink.  I opted to install an outlet.  I cut the hole, installed a post work wire box and wired a ground circuit outlet in.  Not that any of that has anything to do with the review, just gloating I guess.

I think that's why my grands like them.. Even kids who don't normally express themselves that much about books, find plenty to talk about.  As usual, this one was finished the day after received. My grandson (10), who is very picky about what he reads, disappeared into his room and read half by bedtime. Something about the dark and the conquest of good, in this case the conquest by children, over darkness/evil appeals to him. He was a little disappointed that this was the last one of the series, but he thought it ended \"extremely excellently\".  I read several of these books myself and found them well written and very imaginative.

Alfie had been incredibly sheltered and isolated because of her flighty artistic mother who had her out of wedlock. (This is 2014, right?) Her grandfather who is the Svengali of the book, is a throwback to the 1920's. I don't know, maybe it's different in New Zealand, but he was a MAJOR tool in this American girl's honest opinion. Anyway, back to the paradox, Alfie couldn't have been any greener if she had been raised by nuns. Despite the fact that she works with livestock and is well aware of what goes where. She has been browbeaten so much and for so long by Herr Craftsman, that her sexual identity is zilch. Not only that but he has arranged a marriage, without her knowledge or consent to a man who just shows up on her doorstep. So, at this point I am seriously thinking, it might be time to pull a Menedez on ol' Granpappy. But then some strange insect made me rethink the whole sitch. New Zealand is the home of the cave weta. They only live in this tiny area of the entire world. If New Zealand can breed these critters, well maybe Pops isn't such a strange Kiwi after all.\n\nSeriously, I thought this was photoshopped or something but this a a THING. Rory, the ex-pat Kiwi, who now hails from Texas, actually saved Alfie when a cave weta fell down her shirt. For this he deserves all the sex, and land that he could ever want. Not only did he remove the weta, he put it back in the cave so that it wouldn't die in the sunlight. I love this cowboy. With all his shucks, and darlings, he was just too, too yummy. He was actually a very decent sort, who fell into instant lust with Alfie and resented the way she had been parceled out as part of a land deal. He put a lot of effort into building up her self esteem and giving her some independence. He was also a very dirty cowboy, and I'm not talking trail dust, nosireebob! He gives Alfie some hands on training in animal husbandry. *snort*\n\nFor under one hundred and fifty pages, this was a well written, quick but satisfying romance that taught me a few things, some good and some I'll have nightmares about. *ewwwww* I think the whole weta incident pretty much put the kibosh on any future trips to New Zealand, so I guess I'll have to rely on more books from Kris to satisfy my wanderlust.

Never could she have imagined that a tragedy could change her life forever.\n\nThe emotions are what made this story so good. Evanders need for something more resonated with me.

Anne, Marjory, and Elizabeth have each experienced painful pasts and find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances. They've lost their wealth, societal position, and family members to the failed Jacobite Rebellion. As they begin new lives, they expect no special treatment and determine to accept whatever hard work and deprivation the future may require. However, God--who delights in bestowing so much more than His children could ever ask or think--fills their lives with favor, abundant joys, and unexpected love.\n\nAs I read the story, I couldn't help but think of the many times God has surprised me with His good gifts.

It did a great job covering every facet of Daniel's amazing life as covered in the Bible. Most films will focus only on the lions den but this goes in depth. I enjoyed more than the episode of, The Bible which focused on Daniel. Most adaptations of Biblical narratives will require some speculation to fill in blanks that a movie but the Bible doesn't cover and I really liked how this movie did that.  I love the idea that Daniel was so dedicated and so faithful to King Darius that he advised there was no legal loophole and that Daniel be thrown into the lion's Den quickly so as not to give fuel to the King's political enemies. That the faith and faithfulness of Daniel. I also liked the scenes of Daniel discussing Isaiah's prophecy regarding Cyrus with Cyrus. Although I doubt it happened, it did a good job communicating through film the amazing nature of Isaiah's prophecy.\n\nThe film had some solid performances including Robert Miano as Old Daniel, really embodying the role of an Old Testament prophet  and Rolf Saxon was great as Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe film featured some cheesy performances, mostly from minor characters such as the Babylonian astrologers. Of the more important players, Lance Henriksen seemed  too subdued as Cyrus.\n\nCostuming was a problem particularly with jewelry. Because of his jewelry, one of the astrologers reminded me of a rapper. When Belshazzar gave Daniel the gold chain, it looked so obviously fake like a prop from a church play.\n\nThe one scene the direction really let down was the finger of God writing on the wall. The scene went too fast with Belshazzar demanding a solution before the finger finished. That's a moment that would have been better with people terrified and then we get the King's response.\n\nOverall, though, this movie is good for what it is: a well written, low budeget faithful DVD adaptation of the life of Daniel. I enjoyed it.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21865", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

As a lad of 5, Bretton's family was destroyed when de Velt  conquered Four Crosses Cast, Bretton's home. Now, 25 years later, Bretton is taking revenge for his families death.  His goal: regain Four Crosses Castle and kill de Velt. After kidnapping Lady Allaston Eugenia Coleby de Velt, de Velt's  daughter, Bretton's goal was strengthened.  Now he had leverage in his quest, along with his army..  More than conquer and kill, Devil's Dominion is about a man hardened by life, being taught the side of life that includes loving and caring, feelings he was not familiar with during his life.  I loved the relationship between Bretton and Allaston. She was not the type to just remain quiet.  She constantly was making Bretton thinking and looking at life from a different view. The writing of this story was wonderful.  It is written such a way that you forget all else but what is happening in the book. Reading a Kathryn Le Veque book is like visiting old friends.  Although this is a stand alone book, you catch up with characters from previous books.  It is always so great to see other facets of the persons you meet previously in other Kathryn's books.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "21868", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

A couple of years ago I had an armband by BodyMedia which has sense gone out of business.  That was a much more accurate (but expensive) tool so I came to this one with not very high expectations, but honestly, for it's price point it is very high quality, and has some pretty amazing features.\n\nFirst of all, I have very tiny wrists and this has enough holes that I can get a good fit.  I also love that the digital reading is crystal clear and that I can swipe the screen of the watch and easily move from time/battery life to steps taken to calories burned to sleep mode etc.  It is very easy to set up and use and syncs easily with my iPhone.\n\nOverall, it is very comfortable to wear and lightweight, but it does shift periodically and I get a little vibration that tells me that it's not making a full connection and I can adjust - cool feature.\n\nCons: I don't believe the step count is wholly accurate and this could be do to the watch slipping on my wrist periodically, but I compared this with my former armband and this is not as accurate.  It is good for a ballpark measure and it certainly is accurate enough you get a good general idea, but it is not the same as the 100-200 dollar fitness bands.\n\nIs it worth the money - yes :).  It's much better than just a plain old pedometer, it gives you good incentive and it's easy to use.  You may want to start with this and as you progress, consider investing in a more expensive gizmo to track calories, and sleep cycles better but overall this is a great tool and I would definitely recommend it.\n\nIf you look at my pic you'll see the closing clasps - they are like little metal rods that stick up and the holes go over them.  They are very secure and I like that feature a lot.  The screen is great too very easy to read.  The battery level in my picture is after 3 & 1/2 days of continuous use - so it gets excellent battery life.  Overall this product meets my expectations.\n\nI received a complimentary product in exchange for a thorough test and honest review.

Usually anything built this well i expect to find for 30 dollars or more. I also saw a lot of people saying they hated the eject button to get the mixer blades out is horrible because it is in the same place as where the speed settings are and they were worried about turning it on while trying to eject the blades. I however do not see an issue with it turning on unless your are careless when doing it. You can also just pull the blades out with out even pushing the button to eject them and it won't hurt them and by doing it that way you would have to worry about accidentally turning it on for whatever reason. I used this for mashing potatoes and it did the job fine and actually a lot better then my old one and this one has a lot more power which i really love.

You can find someone \"poo pooing\" all over even $5,000+ systems.  I'm not an audiophile music nut but can appreciate a good quality product for music and movies.  That's what Sonos provides.  The audio is clear and beautiful.  However, if you are able to hardwire speakers and spend a bunch, this might not be a good fit.  For me, I had limited ability to subcontract out when my house was being built so I didn't want to punch a bunch of holes in the wall and snake near-endless wires around.\n\nSonos gave me exactly what I was looking for with minimal wires and superior sound for the amount.  Bose technology is not as innovative as it once was and Sonos provides equal or better quality for a comparable if not cheaper price.  I currently only have the playbar and subwoofer hooked up and the ease at which I can control everything through my iPhone is remarkable. I plan on adding two Play 1s when finances allow.  I can control the volume and stream music and internet radio with no fuss.  This product deserves 4-5 stars for what it is.  I will update this review when I buy the two additional speakers to add to a more balanced sound that is closer to surround sound. The two pieces I have now are very impressive products. Kodos to Sonos.\n\nUPDATE: 3/17/15\n\nI didn't want to heavily edit my previous review so you can see how things have changed for me.  I downgraded the star rating to two stars but could have given it a three as well.  My dissatisfaction with Sonos is largely due to its abysmal performance at producing the proper sound through my television.  I have last year's model for Sharp with their Aquos Q+ which is a superior television in my opinion and has some of the latest technology.  My current Sonos system consists of the playbar, subwoofer, and wifi extender. I have zero complaints in regards to the system producing top-notch sound when streaming anything over my iphone.  The issues arise with the television and the playbar's random flaws, which have become very annoying.  I have done the troubleshooting to correct issues and only short term relief has been experienced.  At first, I would get shows and movies in which the sound would drop out here and there for a few seconds at a time.  Now, I have constant variations with the sound levels once the television is turned on.  Additionally, I randomly get the wonderfully horrible \"robotic tone\" coming from actors talking and this can only be returned to normal when I change the channel and change it back.  Maybe these things can be fixed but ask yourself this: If you just spent over $1500 on a soundbar, subwoofer, wifi extender, did the recommended troubleshooting and still had issues, would you be fed-up?

The co-chairs make sure to state in their introduction (\"To the reader of NETS\") that it is intended for \"a biblically well-educated audience...that has a more than passing interest in traditions of biblical liturature other than their own.\" And, in accord with Nida & Taber's thoughts on translations (1982), it is envisaged as \"a translation in the present-day literary language, so as to communicate to the well-educated constituency.\"\n\nThe primary text runs 1027 pages. The paper is of pretty high quality, though the typeface is a bit smallish. Each printed page of text is only about approximately 6 inches wide and 9 inches tall.  There are no maps. The footnotes tend to follow the NRSV.\n\nAlso, remember that this is an English translation of a Greek translation of a Hebrew/Aramaic original (except for a few that are originally in just the Greek (e.g., Editions to Esther), and that the English translation uses the NRSV as its foundational base (versus the NKJV for the Orthodox Study Bible's Septuagint-derived OT). Thus, it can often read...idiosyncratically. It is its own unique translation.\n\nAny potential reader must keep aware of their choices regarding places and names. That that are \"as translations of Herew (or Aramaic), i.e., names in general use in the Hellenstic world apart from the LXX\" are in their modern standard English equivalent. So they use Egypt and Syria. However, \"as transcriptions of Hebre (or Aramaic), i.e., names produced de nove from the source language\" are translated as English transcriptions. Thus, David is Dauid. And Solomon is Salomon.  Thus, this can be a bit of a hard casual read as the reader has to keep reminding himself of the name in question. For example, Leviticus is Leuitikon, Deuteronomy is Deuteronomion, Joshua is Iesous, Ruth is Routh, Judith is Ioudith, Maccabees is Makkabees, Ecclesiastes is Ecclesiast, etc. (The spellings might only appeal to RCs who love their Vulgate (from the Latin).) This can really slow down the modern English speaker who is so used to the modern spellings. Thus this book isn't designed for liturgical use or as a truly modern English equivalent work using standardized spellings.\n\nMost of the books are translated from the Gottingen Edition (a long-term work in progress). Where they are not, they revert back to the older Rahlfs (Stuttgart: 1935). e.g., Proverbs & Ecclesiastes.  The order followed appears to be fully congruent with the Greek Orthodox Church variant (see Orthodox Study Bible, 2008, though this excludes 4 Maccabees), broken out into 4 categories (Laws, Histories, Poetic Books, and Prophecies); the Apocrypha/Deutero-canonical books are included interspersed throughout the OT, and it ends with Daniel (which goes Susanna/Daniel/Bel & the Dragon).\n\nWhat makes this work so valuable include:\n\n- letter to the reader from the co-chairs,\n- the identification of each translator for each specifc work,\n- the wonderful introductions for each work by the individual translator, and, most importantly,\n- the Psalms of Solomon are translated,\n- the additional variant readings of various books.\n\nThus there are two versions of Judges, Esther, Tobit, and Daniel (including the additions, in Old Greek and Theodotion versions). These additional versions are worth the price of the book alone!\n\nA few small things bug me.\n\n- The Prayer of Manasses (Manasseh), translated from Rahlfs' Ode 12, is buried at the end of Psalms, after Psalm 151.\n- The Book of Nehemiah is in 2 Esdras 11-23; it is just barely noted in the introduction and text.\n- There is no lengthy discussion about the Septuagint in general, or its use of the Septuagint in the Christian Church over the centuries (e.g., Orthodox & Roman Catholic (canonical scripture) vs Anglican/Lutheran (in Bible but not used for dogma) vs general Protestant (not in Bible)), or the differences in the \"canon\" of these works across Orthodox (longest), Roman Catholic (shortest), with Anglican & Lutheran disagreeing (in 1 & 2 Esdras: in Anglican KJV but not Luther's Bible), though each has slightly more books than Roman Catholic.  For this type discussion, see the recently published The Apocrypha--Lutheran Edition with Notes (Concordia Publishing House, 2012; using full ESV Apocrypha from Oxford University Press, 2009).\n\nAnyone interested in the Septuagint should have, read, and study this outstanding work. It deserves to be in any serious English-speaking Christian's biblical library.  The Septuagint was the OT used by Greek-speaking Jews in the period before and after Christ, and thus was the basis for the early Church's OT, used by the Apostles and the Patristic Fathers.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.79}, {"id": "21902", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I loved the lead characters and their actors, as well as the supporting roles. I honestly had forgotten who the killer was, and had to be surprised all over again when the climax of the movie hits. As I was in college during the time period when the movie was made, it was nostalgic for me to see the phone booths and the bulletin boards in the middle of campus the way things used to be in America's colleges. Alas, things have changed in the 21st century. One interesting note to see are the beginnings of email, which at that time was only used by governmental or media agencies and of course college campuses.\n\nBuy this movie on DVD and you will not be disappointed.

That's as good a summation as I can muster.\nIt's not about cognitive neurology and vast computer networks meshing into one literate machine.  It's about one man's search for the loves and lives he's lost.  Richard Powers - the character in the book and possibly the author as well - has lost friends and family and lovers.  He's also lost his passion for literature and his willingness to write fiction.  The ten months he spends with Helen (the title character, so to speak), training her to compete in a master's level comprehensive English exam allows him to remember those moments in his life where things went wrong.  And change them.  Or so he thinks.\nHelen reminded me of \"Flowers for Algernon\"; she's Charlie Gordon (by way of HAL 9000), only we never get to see her private journal, and she's housed inside an enormous computer network.  Powers handles well her gradual introduction to the language.  In the beginning she makes mistakes with syntax, and they always seem quite plausible, as if really coming from a machine learning English from scratch.  Eventually, she makes leaps and bounds, catching both her teacher and the reader off guard.  These are my favourite moments.  I found myself taking a startled step back along with the characters in the book when Helen made her profound and poetic statements.  And just like Charlie Gordon (and HAL), you know that her consciousness must come with a price.\nRichard Powers - the author and possibly the character as well - has written a fine post-sci-fi melodrama.  The story had me engrossed, even as it tried desperately hard to tug on my heartstrings.  Maybe the drama caught me off-guard, for I was expecting cyberpunk but got a tender tale of lost loves.

Enjoyed the first book in the series and this one too is on par. Sexy bikers fighting injustice on Mars. Hell Yeah!\n\nSo the earth has been damaged so badly that humans have been convinced to move to Mars and live under the oppressive leadership of a man called Wexmen. Women are property to be owned. Blacks are slaves and homosexuality is illegal. Not to mention a host of other things. So bad men are in power and the good men are the bikers who are branded outlaws because they fight against the regime. The risk is high if they are caught. Punishment can range from imprisonment to death by execution.\n\nKnox aka Outlaw it the President of Outlaw MC and Liam aka Lover is the VP. They've been friends since they were boys and started the motorcycle club together. But over the years, Outlaw has been so concentrated on taking down Wexmen, he's put his own love life on hold and ignored the 'lover' staring him in the face. Pun intended. He is attracted to Liam/Lover but since homosexuality is illegal he's been worried about being caught and sent to jail and not completing his ambition of taking down the government. We get to see Knox's past and understand his fears.\n\nBut his secrets attraction to Lover couldn't stay hidden forever and things come to a head between then when Lover is injured. These two made us wait to the very end to get their act together but it's worth it. Plus theirs enough out of bedroom action to keep the reader entertained with the rescue of the slave. Someone please tell me Justice has his own story somewhere. Perhaps not in this series but their should be a series for the Underground MC if there isn't one already.

Nix lives on an enchanted pirate ship, The Temptation, that can sail to any place for which a map existsno matter what time period its from or what kind of reality it depicts. Captained by her father, the ship has taken Nix to a grand variety of placesfrom the land of One Thousand and One Arabian Nights to modern-day New York City. But though he could go anywhere and anytime, Nixs father only seeks one location: Hawaii in the 1860s, when Nix was born and when her mother died. The only way he can get there is by obtaining a map drawn of that era and in that era, and hes so hell-bent on going back in time to save his wife that he never pauses to think about what this might mean for his daughter. Nix, on the other hand, is all too aware that his actions could erase her lifeher dreams of captaining her own ship, her friendships with the crew (particularly the charming Persian thief, Kash), any hope for a future.\n\nThe bulk of the novel takes place in 1880s Honolulu, where Nix, her father, and the crew chase yet another lead for the map Nixs father wants so desperately. Funnily enough, this is actually the era Nix would have lived in if she hadnt spent her life on board a time-hopping barge. Its here that Nix meets Blake, a kind-souled American boy who offers, for the first time she can remember, a reason to stay in one place. There is a bit of a love triangle between Nix and the two boys in her lifeKash and Blakeand honestly, I didn't know who to root for. Both love interests are charming, though in very different ways, and both seem to genuinely care about Nix. And I loved reading her dialogues with each of them the characters really came alive for me, and I found myself more invested in them than I meant to.\n\nThe romance is just a small part of the story, though. The plot follows Nix in her efforts to both obtain the map for her father and discover her own pastwhich, it turns out, is much more complicated than she imagined. THE GIRL FROM EVERYWHERE is a wonderfully imaginative and refreshingly unique book with fantastic world-building and truly memorable characters. The settings really come to life and, in a way, they're characters in the book as well. I loved how Heilig explored places that aren't often seen in books, adding something different and lovely to the world of YA. Nix is an intrepid and sympathetic heroineone whos fearless in her actions yet whose emotions fill the page with relatable vulnerabilityand I really enjoyed the combination of wit, snark, and rawness in her voice. Also, it was great seeing a hapa girl get the spotlight for a change.\n\nOne of the real highlights for me was when Nix ended up in the fantastical necropolis of a ruthless Chinese emperor, Qin Shi Huang. This is part of a history and mythology Id grown up hearing snatches of, but never really seen depicted in fiction (unless you count the third Mummy movie, which... meh). The vivid descriptions, the sense of a lost world come to life, the meticulous research that clearly went into writing about this place actually, these things apply to all the settings.\n\nAnyway, THE GIRL FROM EVERYWHERE is a truly enjoyable fantasy adventure with characters I couldn't get enough of. I was listening to the audiobook version while on an 11+ hour drive across half the country, and that drive went by way too quickly. The narrator does a beautiful job of bringing Heiligs words to life in a way that feels genuine and inviting. I highly recommend it to anyone whos looking for something magical and different, something with writing that really pops and sparkles.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "21938", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

With The Humanoid Touch, he revives the humanoids - robots whose Prime Directive is to protect Man from harm.  The Humanoids debuted in \"With Folded Hands\" in the late 1940s (which I've read) and in the novel The Humanoids (which I've not).  In The Humanoid Touch, a last bastion of humanity tries to hide from or fight against the inevitable humanoid advance.\nWilliamson's humanoids are provocative in every sense.  What happens when robots become too perfect, no matter how \"benevolent\" their intentions?  There is a latent horror throughout the book as the characters realize the humanoids are near.  Williamson succeeds in creating the aura of fear that Saberhagen hints at with his Berserkers, or Star Trek with the Borg.  Williamson's humanoids, however, are far more terrifying than either - who would have thought the words \"At your service\" could induce such spine-tingling horror?\nThe human characters more or less get in the way of the true protagonists, and here is where Williamson's skills perhaps aren't quite up to snuff.  The interaction and personal relationships between characters is not much more advanced than in his 1930s pulp sci-fi Legion series (a nevertheless fine read).  And the ending doesn't sit right; it's on the one hand too pat, and on the other too troubling - I can't say more without divulging spoilers.\nAll in all, however, this one ranks as a must read by all science fiction fans.  The humanoids are among sci-fi's greatest creations, easily the equal of Dune's Fremen or Asimov's psychohistory.  If you thought the Borg were creepy, you haven't seen anything until you've seen the humanoids.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21942", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Or serving Him well? Or are doing enough? You just know if you do one more thing in the name of God you will have found what has been missing from your spiritual life. For whatever reason, you are always running after God, running after religion.\n\nAngie Smith knows this all too well. Instead of enjoying God, she found herself chasing him, diving in to religion and in the process was coming up dry. In her new book, Chasing God, Smith encourages the reader to stop grasping for straw and instead grab a hold of God, our sustenance, He who is substance. Religion can be confining following rules, making checklists and exhausting oneself. Yet, God doesn't want us to add another \"to-do\" for us to be holier. He wants us to seek Him for the purpose of resting in His glory, to know Him a little more intimately and embrace His extended hands. God wants us to enjoy Him for who He is, not what we want Him to be.\n\nThis was another book that was placed in my hands at the needed moment. I began feeling empty and closed the book with a renewed sense of longing and hope in my spiritual life. Smith validates feelings of doubt and other feelings we are shamed to acknowledge during our walk. It is easy to think if we are experiencing a lull in our journey than we aren't doing enough. However, it may be we are doing too much and missing God. What it comes down to is an understanding that what we are chasing may not be there, but what is may far exceed our expectations. In His abundance we can be fulfilled.\n\nChasing God is an experience to be had, not a book to skim through. We are blessed to have authors, such as Angie Smith, gracing our shelves with a vulnerability and candor that is accessible, a pen that soothes and words which inspire. I simply couldn't put this book down. I wanted more. I needed more. The greatest aspect of Smith's work is she doesn't prescribe more rules on us or another set of miraculous self-help steps. She uses her journey as case in point and draws upon life. Somethings that may work for her, may not for you. Just as each of us are unique, so will be our journeys, completely different, yet all wonderful. I can assure you that Chasing God is a book that will impact you and your journey. May you stop chasing and begin knowing God.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21950", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

First of all the author is a great writer being both incredibly funny and intelligently philosophical through out this book. You like her immediately as a person and as a writer. But maybe even more importantly, her brutal honesty about her own shortcomings, those of her family, her acquaintances and people everywhere leads to a truly insightful and honest look at the changing (but maybe not changing quickly enough) attitudes about mixed-race unions.\n\nThis book is an excellent read. I would have given it 5 stars but for a few factors. First, there is a lot of information that is given in respect to the family history's of those she spoke to that is not only a bit unnecessary, but slows the story to almost a halt at points. This is not a deal breaker on the greatness of the book, but does start to numb the mind a bit in short spurts.\n\nMostly I took great exception to one particular passage in the book. While Diane is fervently and passionately championing a society where we no longer see race, color, religion, etc. she makes one very unfair and uncharacteristically generalizing comment which I felt was not only inaccurate, but also unfair. Diane tells of one friend whose mother, Kusum, went to meet the mother of her son's fianc. The couple was of a different race and religion from each other. When the topic of religion is brought up and an uncomfortable dialog follows Diane writes, \"...maybe Kusum's heavy heart caused her to dismiss the fact that devout followers of any faith rarely read material published outside their safety zone or converse with people leading a secular life\".\n\nOh, Diane...boo! In the midst of a book which champions tolerance, understanding and not making blind, sweeping judgments about any group you chose to write a line aimed directly at devout members of ANY faith? I am a life-long and very devout member of my faith. I attend LDS church every single week and then, during the week, may have lunch with any one of my Atheist, Jewish, Catholic, Agnostic, et al friends. I regularly study other faiths' beliefs and literature and teach my children about them as I feel is my obligation as a mother raising children to accept ALL people, no matter how different they may seem. Last Christmas after we told the tale of Christ's birth straight from the Bible our entire family sat down and played with a dreidel while I told my kids about the Jewish faith and the traditions of Chanukah.\n\nYou undermined the very soul of your book with that misguided statement.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21959", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I'm glad I did, because it wasn't long before he began to endear himself. He was a bit one step up and two steps back at first but he grew so much. And when his past came out it was understandable that he'd turned out the way he had. When the story began he was probably one of the most unlikeable male leads I've ever encountered but at the end he had grown so much and was completely adorable. The story is mostly in Richard's POV. There's much less of Katy's, but enough to get a read on her. It's unusual for the male POV to control a story like this but the writer did a great job and it worked. I connected to this disagreeable man and was surprised at how emotional this story made me feel. The plot is fairly predictable, but it's engaging and anyway the strength of the story is Richard. If you can get past his ugliness in the beginning, the payoff is satisfying The Contract is an easy read and worth the very late night it caused me.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "21975", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

When I saw Lips Touch in the bookstore I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so happy I did!\n\nWritten in usual Laini style, Lips Touch Three Times is an anthology of three short stories, all dealing with that scary yet wonderful thing - the first kiss. Each story is completely different from the next.  Each story takes you to a different part of the world, to a different time and to a different myth.\n\nThe first story is about Kizzy, a girl whose loneliness seeps through the pages and makes you feel sadness for her, a girl whose longing attracts the worse kind of fae. While this one was my least favourite - I didn't like the abrupt ending - Laini's descriptive writing allows the reader to feel all that Kizzy feels and, in a way, understand why she does the things she does.\n\nThe second takes the reader to India and the underworld and introduces an Englishwoman, Estelle, who is working with a demon - bartering for the souls of children. This short story has complex, three dimensional characters and was intriguing from the beginning - when Estelle delivers a curse on a baby - to the end - when that baby, now a young girl, wonders if she should push the limits of the curse. In my opinion, the ending was wonderfully thought out and executed.\n\nThe final story - and my personal favourite - introduces you to the dark world of the Druj, where human feelings are longed for, but never understood. This is the longest story in the collection; it is also the darkest. Mab, a prisoner of the Druj from childhood, manages to escape with her daughter and has been hiding from the Druj since. When a Druj she trusted enters her life again and tries to take her daughter away, the reason isn't what Mab - or the reader - expects.\n\nLips Touch Three Times is just a sampling of Laini's beautiful writing and promises to leave the reader wanting more.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "21978", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I've savored every word of Didion's nonfiction since reading \"Goodbye To All That\" (the final essay of Slouching Toward Bethlehem) in a nonfiction class in college , and she's never let me down.  It's not simply that Didion is one of our greatest writers, its that her style is so incisive and unforgettable because she works with only a whisper of the incredible effort and vision she creates, she undoes the reader with observations that don't appear to be observations - she makes her conclusions about culture, nature, and humanity the only conclusions, and she can devastate, over and over again, in a single sentence.  It's crazy to think of all of the nonfiction books I've bought of hers fitting concisely into under 1200 pages, but how lucky for the people that own this book to be able to do what took me years to do - track down each piece and appreciate it separately (except for the uber-successful Year of Magical Thinking, which still requires its own purchase).  I hope readers take the time to appreciate the differences in each work, to consider how time and how Didion's consciousness adjusted from one book to the next, but the important thing is that she continue to be read and enjoyed.  Here, you can read a piece like \"Goodbye to All That,\" or \"Quiet Days In Malibu,\" or that devastating final chapter of Where I Was From to hear that beautiful, plaintive, liberating sad voice, and then follow it up with Salvador or \"In The Realm of the Fisher King\" or \"Vichy Washington\" and appreciate a cunning that rips into politics and the culture at large.  One strange review on here stated that it was unlikely Didion's work would outlast her life much, and while I don't know that to be untrue (I mean, she's still alive), one thing I've loved about her is that any contextual writing she does - writing about Joan Baez in the 60's, say, or seeing Georgia O'Keefe in the 70's, or Miami, or El Salvador, or Reagan or Hawaii - feels current because it speaks to the human observation watching it occur, and because the culture we make up (the \"stories we tell ourselves\") around whatever's occuring always remain the same.  I wasn't alive or cognizant when much of what she writes about occurs, but to me, Didion's one of the great writers that made me feel connected to the world, feel less alone, and feel thrilled at every topic she's discussed.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "21981", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

She describes overeating as a child and teenager, and then later as a college student.  In college, she made the committment to lose a serious amount of weight, which eventually resulted in a 135 lb weight loss.  After her substantial weight loss, she gets a job on a movie set, and realizes that she is accepted for who she is and the work she does and not for how she looks.  She openly describes her relationship issues with parents, girlfriends, co-workers, and men.  She realizes eventually that she has substituted an addiction to physical excercise as her replacement for food before she tempers the exercise to reasonable levels.  In the end, she comes back to food by creating a blog and working toward spreading the word about healthy eating, exercise and healthy choices.  My only criticism of the story is the excessive amount of time early in the book where she describes gooey, rich foods and how she both loves and hates them.  It just felt like the book was a bit padded there to make it longer.  But I think Mitchell has done an excellent job of describing how trapped she became by her choices until she made the very difficult decision to change her choices.  Her book is positive without being Pollyanna-ish.

While the vocals are always at their best, its the songs that need a great deal of work. \"Wrong\", which is HEAVILY influenced by Christina Aguilera's \"Fighter\", \"Have You Ever Been in Love\", \"Now I Can Fly\" & \"Coulda Been\" are prime examples of this, but the album isn't a complete flop. The first single, \"8th World Wonder\", is the best track by any of the American Idol finalists, and a cover of \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is fantastic. \"I Could\" and \"Before\" are also very good and my strong favorites for a second single.

Most memorable are the Peter Lorre character, the police commissioner and the miserable old pawn broker.  Lorre's complex character deserves careful dissection.  He lives in abject poverty but, with the help of his poor mother, manages to graduate with high honors with a degree in criminology.  His future--and the future of his family--should be guaranteed except for the fact that our 'hero' is idiosyncratic to the point of deep pathology.  He has a schizoid personality disorder characterized, in part, by truly incredible arrogance and delusions of grandeur.  He commits a murder which is almost a 'thrill kill.'  He thinks he can commit the perfect crime because he is far more intelligent than the police.\n\nHere is where I think the film is misdirected.  It should have, in my opinion, been a study of the unrelenting power of a guilty conscience.  The character should have behaved rather intelligently and coolly until 'done in' by his own guilty soul.  Instead the director produces a character who is so peculiar, weird and unlikeable that he draws attention to himself.  His guilt is a neon sign.  Not just once but over and over.  Ultimately he leaves no room for himself.  Everybody knows he is guilty.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211027", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I've read a couple of Anne Rice books (though the first book of her Mayfair Witches series captured me more than Lestat ever did) and seen a few fang movies; the onslaught of vampire drivel that's out there now (especially that overhyped and underwritten Mormon abstinence parable masquerading as teen romance) has done very little to sway my opinion.  Therefore, I approached Cronin's The Passage with understandable trepidation.  Could this new vampire menace really be that much different than all the others?  Well, as long as they didn't sparkle in the sun like diamonds I figured I could at least give it a try...\n\nIt only took me a few pages to get hooked on this almost unclassifiable story.  Yes, it's a horror novel, and the horror is there by the bucketful, but the horror dished out by Cronin's nouveau vampires is no worse than the horror humans do to one another (this is nothing new for readers of dystopian literature, but it bears repeating).  What surprised me the most was that between moments of bloodshed, this book read like a literary novel...and a good one at that.  Perhaps I'm jaded, but with a few rare exceptions I have to get my fixes for horror/suspence and finely-crafted storytelling in very different places.  This book, I am happy to say, is one of those rare exceptions.\n\n[SMALL SPOILER AHEAD!]\n\nWhat I was most compelled by was the way that the story transformed.  After spending a good portion of the story with Amy and her kidnapper/protector/father figure and other characters related to that time period, the book swiftly and effortlessly shifts forward almost a century into the future (with divider notes that suggest a future even further beyond that) where civilization has broken down after the viral plague.  Here we meet new characters who must contend with these manmade monsters and create lives for themselves within heavily fortified walls.  When this new story finally comes back into contact with the former story through the arrival of Amy (not like the other virals but no longer entirely human), the novel takes a dramatic turn that once again upsets the \"natural order\" of the world and catapaults the characters toward their destinies.\n\nMy one complaint with the book is that the author is far too fond of ending chapters with \"cliffhangers\" that seem to indicate certain doom for one or more of the beloved characters, and then returning to the situation with an almost unbelievable conclusion that puts everything back to rights.  After a while, this overused device takes a little of the suspenseful sting out of these events...why worry if you can be fairly certain that all will be right with the world?  Luckily the author delivers enough surprises (and carnage) to keep readers from fully growing complacent, and the cliffhangers at the end of the novel will have readers impatiently awaiting the next installment.  Let's just hope that Cronin can deliver his sequels on a schedule more in line with the horror writer inside of him rather than the literary author.

Rated 3.75 of 5\n\nAlthough I love to read, and I read a lot, I grew up a child of the television age.  As one of those first generation 'latch-key' kid, the television was my nanny.  And when I moved to Hollywood, it was television that I had hoped to break in to.  I am also one of those individuals who has a number of somewhat obscure television references books (and have had for probably thirty years now).  And so, this is precisely the sort of book that I really, really like.\n\n<em>Television Fast Forward</em> is a reference book about the \"Sequels and Remakes of Cancelled Series\" from 1955 to 1992.\n\nWe all know, and probably comment on the fact that Hollywood doesn't ever come up with anything new, but instead just resurrects old shows..  But do you have any idea just how many old series' really are brought back to life on the screen?  This is the book to fill you in.  I'm fairly savvy about television, even if it's a show I've never watched myself, I often know about it and all its incarnations (thank you obscure reference books!).  But even so, I picked up on a few things that were new to me here. (For instance [just one of many], I never knew that there was an un-aired pilot made from <em>The Greatest American Hero</em>, called <em>The Greatest American Heroine</em>.)\n\nBecause I am a little strange and will even read a reference book cover to cover, I also picked up on some small tidbits.  For instance...I never knew that Warren Zevon did music for a television show (a 1993 remake of <em>Route 66</em>) or that Sandra Bullock appeared in a 1989 movie called <em>The Bionic Showdown</em> - a sequel to <em>The Six Million Dollar Man</em> and <em>The Bionic Woman</em> (one of four sequels).\n\nThere are a couple of things that I didn't like about this book.\n\n1) This book was originally released in 1992 and all the sequel/remake information only is complete to that point.  At the end of the book there is an appendix of \"Television Series Revivals 1992-2015\" which lists the television shows, but doesn't give any of the fantastic background information that Goldberg provides for the older shows.  There is also an appendix \"Television Series Remakes 1992-2015\" which is the same - just a list with no background.  Although the Star Trek section does include the J.J. Abrams first 'reboot' movie\n\n2) I recognize that what I have is an Advanced Reader Copy, but the number of spelling, typography, and simple proof-reading errors was disappointing.  One would hope that if this was published in 1992, any errors from that publication would have been corrected and that there should not be new errors in the old copy.  But we have, about Star Trek, the sentence that it was \"just about arty story could be told\" (sic) and its creator was Gene Rodden berry (sic).\n\nBut still, this is precisely the sort of book that I want on my bookshelf (not on my kindle) so that I can refer to it periodically.  If you are a fan of television, you'll want this, too!\n\nLooking for a good book?  Television Fast Forward is a fantastic reference book on the subject of sequels and remakes of television shows.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "211044", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

At the time, Harrison Ford (circa 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back\") was my perfect choice for Green Lantern's live-action movie adaptation.  In June 2011, Warner Bros. & DC Comics finally release a Green Lantern film, leaving audiences to settle for Ryan Reynolds as the title character.  Of available actors, either he or, better yet, Chris Pine were arguably the best known options.  Reynolds subsequently fails to impress in an estimated $300 million production (upon factoring in all the promotional costs).  His shallow efforts are further deep-sixed by an awful script and gaudy CGI special effects imbuing this vastly disappointing film with all the aura of an overblown video game.\n\nDirector Martin Campbell seemed a logical, slam-bang choice to initiate \"Green Lantern\" into a super-hero film franchise.  Having seen his high octane efforts reviving Zorro (with Antonio Banderas & Catherine Zeta-Jones) and James Bond twice (with Pierce Brosnan and later Daniel Craig), Campbell normally has a knack of capturing sleek, inspired performances from his actors.  This time, though, Campbell's cast  offers a collective sleepwalking job, as I've seen Green Lantern cartoons with better acting.  Additional sabotage comes from this movie's lackluster script incoherently blending elements from various Green Lantern storylines, which leaves its target PG-13 audience to only undemanding viewers in the 12-25 crowd.\n\nThe film immediately stumbles into a \"Battlestar Galactica\"-like voice-over prologue by explaining far too much too soon.  Eerily enough, actor Geoffrey Rush's voice-over even mimics Patrick Macnee's voice from \"Galactica.\"  Without revealing crucial spoilers, the filmmakers should have saved vital revelations about planet Oa's existence and the Green Lantern Corps for a proposed sequel.  There wasn't enough screen time to sufficiently develop Parallax, Hector Hammond, and even Sinestro into villains all in one film.  Although the game plan was to set up the franchise with an awesome Green Lantern vs. Sinestro sequel, the combination of such a crummy script with an over-abundance of obviously fake CGI makes for a dreadful viewing experience.  If the film had plausibly focused on a raw, mysterious origin (where rookie Hal desperately believes he is the only Green Lantern vs. imminent cosmic destruction), the end result could have been immensely better.  In fairness, the movie's best asset is the inclusion of reliable actors in various supporting roles: i.e. the late Michael Clarke Duncan, Geoffrey Rush, Clancy Brown, Angela Bassett, Jay O. Sanders, Jon Tenney, and Tim Robbins.  Unfortunately, the mind-numbing plot gives them familiar characters (i.e. Kilowog, Tomar-Re, Amanda Waller, Abin Sur, and the Jordan family) with so little to do.\n\nThis film's worst offense, ultimately, is its flagrant pushing of CGI to hide how crummy the movie really is.  Case in point: the ultra-fake opening sequence depicting outer space is flat-out laughable.  An immediate sense that this movie is in deep trouble continues as even Hal & Carol's jets flying over the California desert is just another helping of CGI.  Utilizing some models (or even recycling stock footage of real \"Top Gun\" jets) would have been far more credible.  It doesn't take long before viewers will realize they are watching actors lazily going through the green-screen motions, treating \"Green Lantern\" merely as a paycheck movie.  As this cast carelessly fails to sell viewers on suspending total disbelief, the film's over-reliance on CGI becomes sadly apparent.  Hence, the film squanders an enormous optical effects budget resulting in nothing more real than an emerald fireworks show.\n\nConsidering the insane amount of money Warner Bros already lost on this movie, the planned 2020 reboot makes sense, provided there are four HUGE conditions:  1. Hire a compatible director (someone who actually grasps why a fearless Hal Jordan (or John Stewart) is Green Lantern; 2. Get the right Hal (perhaps Garrett Hedlund) or John (maybe Michael Jai White); 3.  The cast must provide inspired, high-caliber efforts; and 4. Far more attention is focused on an intelligent script first rather than simply gambling it all on CGI.\n\nI lucked out skipping the theater experience by later finding the blu-ray at a cheap price.  If only once, my young son and I could be kids together gleefully seeing my favorite childhood super-hero come to life.  I just wish this \"Green Lantern\" film had met more than just a fraction of its vast potential.  Instead, \"Green Lantern\" is really a second coming of Ben Affleck's dreadful 2003 Daredevil movie (including Reynolds' smug, Affleck-like performance).\n\nRating: 4/10 (Updated in August 2015).\n\nNote: There are two gruesome scenes inside a secret laboratory in the film's second half that I would advise not letting children see -- parents will know when they watch the film.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.79}, {"id": "211048", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Firstly, the jokes are more frequent and are less dated sounding and I found myself laughing at them although I was born more than 3 decades later and overall \"The Thin Man\" moves along at a good pace making it for me the true Best Picture of 1934.  Woody Van Dyke was also the better director although I can see how the screenplay award could go down to the wire.\n\nAs the second best movie of 1934, this movie has a few good things going for it although to call it the best ever screwball romantic comedy would be ridiculous as there are many better ones such as \"My Girl Friday\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\" just to name a couple let alone \"The Thin Man\", as it does have a pretty good screenplay and both Gable and Claudette have a good on-screen chemistry.  I thought the film dragged on a little though and was not as smooth flowing as say \"The Thin Man\" and the \"logic\" of going on foot instead of continuing on the bus and in not telling Ellie why he had to go and get gas in the middle of the night escapes me but what made this film great is the great acting of both Gable and Claudette who both deserved their Oscars although I can see why Bette Davis would feel aggrieved after her great performance in \"Of Human Bondage\".\n\nThe problem with this DVD though is the very poor sound and visual quality of the transfer when compared with \"The Thin Man\".  Perhaps the original masters were better preserved for the latter film but the difference in quality is night and day if you can get a copy of the DVDs to compare them you'll see what I mean.  A little known fact about this movie though is that the scene on the cover is what inspired the creation of Bugs Bunny as creator Chuck Jones stated that he saw Gable as a \"big rabbit\" and if you watch early Bugs Bunny cartoons, you'll see more than a slight resemblance to Peter Warne as portrayed in the movie.\n\nTo conclude, good movie but poor DVD transfer and certainly NOT the best picture of 1934.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211057", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Her 2 older sisters try to discover who was responsible for destroying their father (coincidentally they have 3 suspects) & Sophie decides to go back to their previous home & live in a cottage on the ground estates with their former nanny.\n\nWhen Sophie's nanny has an accident & is taken to a nursing home, in desperation Sophie goes to the Main House with a vague idea of seeking employment. She is met by the butler who immediately takes her for the new cook that they have been expecting which Sophie happily falls in with (being an excellent cook & loving it). The comedy of mistaken identity goes even further with the Viscount who takes her for the courtesan/mistress that he had contracted for from London.\n\nI loved the book! Wonderful writing & storytelling. The author's style of writing is lovely. Fluid & totally carries you along with characters that you immediately feel connected with. Sophie is by no means perfect. She's rather vain. She's beautiful & knows it. She plans to marry a rich, titled gentleman. She still comes across as someone totally likable. Her relationship with Alexander is so amusing! She's quite innocent in a lot of ways & their conversations are full of double entendres which Sophie doesn't realize at all. She's talking about cooking while he takes everything she says in a sexual context (delicious, satisfying his appetite - you get the drift!).\n\nAlexander is totally swoonworthy. The brooding, sardonic hero who, when he falls for Sophie falls hard.\n\nThere's a lovely cast of secondary characters - Alexander's butler/valet Dickens is particularly lovable. It was most touching when all his servants took Sophie's part & were very protective of her.\n\nThis is the 3rd book in the series. I'd not read the previous 2 but had no problems reading this as a standalone.\n\nCopy received from Netgalley for an honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211060", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The rhythmic acoustic strumming, and 'barely there' percussion that  introduces \"All I Want\" is a distinctive, inviting intro to the  LP and sets the tone for what will be a very personal emotional journey.  Throughout this sterling song cycle, Joni lays her soul bare in such  beautiful, loving tunes as \"My Old Man\", \"Carey\"  \"A Case Of You\" and my personal favorites: the gorgeous title  song, \"A Little Green\" and \"The Last Time I Saw  Richard\" , songs so rich in detail they seem to place the listener  right in midst of what's going on. The sound and overall tone of the album  is understated and serene. With only the sparest of backing ( acoustic  guitar, mandolin or piano ) Ms. Mitchell's pristine, shivery soprano is  right out front where it should be, forcing you to hear and feel every  word. This is the album that made the world sit up and really pay attention  to 'singer/songwriters' for the first time. \"Blue\" remains a  highwater mark in pop music.

They usually work and play hard and think of themselves as the luckiest people in the world because they are essentially their own bosses.  The fact that their lives are constantly at risk in the commission of making a living seems to be a minor consideration.  I, like many others, am in awe of people such as this and I found this book to be a fascinating glimpse into what happens when you hit 40 and start to think about settling down.  I think I'd be looking for a nice quiet country place with a yard, maybe a pond too.  Judith Matloff thought it might be nice to raise a family on a block infested with violent psychopathic crackmonsters.  Hey, to each their own!  It makes sense.  If adventure is in your blood, you don't move out to suburbia, even when you \"settle down.\"\n\nI loved reading this book and didn't want it to end.  I found Judith gutsy and compassionate -- two qualities I especially like to find in a person, and so I loved the way she told the story.  She is by turns frightened, witty, compassonate, and ultimately victorious.\n\nI found it hard to believe that some of the people she knew from her reporting days, those who lived in war-ravaged countries where mass murder and rape were common occurrences, were afraid to visit her in Harlem.  When she arrives on the block, and meets her nemesis, the notorious Salami, the local black population knows they've got a chance to get their neighborhood back.  \"They'll listen to you, because you're white,\" one woman says to her.  And it's true.  But it's not only the fact that the author is white that gets things going, it's the fact that she's willing to do the footwork, go to the meetings, chat up the civil servants, and follow through that creates the conditions she, and the rest of the block, are hoping for.\n\nI have never read a memoir of a person who toils in fields of misery for a living.  I finished this book in two days, and wanted more.  The author has a gift for bringing the characters on her block to life.  She sees good everywhere and is only slightly intimidated by even the scariest crackhead.\n\nI got a kick out of the author's husband, who is like many of my Dutch relatives -- a bit arrogant and condescending, in general, and towards the USA most specifically, and I especially enjoyed Mrs. La Dukes.  In fact, this book is packed with indelible characters that I hated to say goodbye to.  I was glad the author provided an epilogue so that we could find out what happened to them.\n\nFive stars, great read!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211070", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Unfortunately there is no one to like.  Rachel is pathetic, Anna selfish, Megan self absorbed and destructive.  Even long suffering flat mate Cathy comes off self righteous.  The men are creeps and manipulative.  Yet I kept reading till the end and gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for two reasons. I hate to admit it but I suppose I have a little horror voyeurism in me and like all those people \"rubber necking\" a car accident, I couldn't stop reading about the truly sad lives of these truly stupid women.  The second reason and perhaps even more disturbing is like those family and friends of addicts who keep hoping that the addict will see the light and STOP, I kept hoping that Rachel would realize that what she got from her addiction wasn't worth what it cost her.  But of course, she kept drinking--and letting the reader down.  In this horrible \"hope\", the author did succeed in getting this reader to \"invest\" in the character of Rachel, hating her and this book for doing so.\n\n**Update.  I watched the movie \"Gone Girl\" and agree.  This book doesn't come close to Gone Girl.  While Girl on the train had no one the reader could cheer on, Amy of Gone Girl was deliciously evil, finding a clever way to get back at her cheating husband.  Again, I didn't read the book Gone Girl, but I really enjoyed the movie. If the book was different, the movie version will have to really change the character of Rachel to pull out a protagonist we could like.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211076", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I got these because there was just too much confusion regarding Amazon's Ferrara Atomic Fireball jawbreakers (i.e. whether they were the \"large\" or \"small\" size, whether they were fresh or not, etc.). So I decided to try the J.R. version. They're good, and have a nice cinnamon flavor, but they are not nearly as hot as the original Atomic Fireballs. For some folks that might be good. But if you're looking for that true hot fire -- where you actually have to think about taking the jawbreaker out of your mouth because it's too hot -- these won't quite fit the bill.\n\nNOTE: After reading all the reviews of the Atomic Fireball jawbreakers, I saw a consistent suggestion: go to Sam's and get them fresh, at a much better price. The only problem is...I don't belong to Sam's. But I do belong to BJs (such a funny name) and I checked online and saw that their stores do carry the 150 piece containers. So tonight I went there and for under $7 including tax I got a 2.5 pound container of fresh (good through 2017) original Atomic Fireballs. (Though these are made in Mexico, whereas the originals were made in the US.) That's definitely the way to go if you want the hottest cinnamon candy on the planet for the best price.

I was wrong. That being said, it does have some wry humour, but this is a very gritty, very honest account of his early years and it was an eye opener for this middle-aged white woman.\n\nI loved the relationship that Trevor and his mother have, it shines through on every page, even if he doesn't always agree or approve of some decisions she has made along the way. She sounds like an amazing lady who has overcome incredible odds to give her son the best possible life.  I can't even fathom a world where having a relationship with someone of another race could cause you to be jailed for years, that is just baffling to me. His mother's issues with her ex caused me to shed some tears (some problems are the same the world over and I could really relate) and I marvelled all over again what a strong and also lucky woman she was. You will have to read the book to know what I mean by that!\n\nThere were a couple of places in this book that were very uncomfortable reading for me, one in particular because I am an animal lover. So I would like to warn anyone who is as soft as I am,  there is a graphic description of animal cruelty contained in this book (not perpetrated by Trevor Noah, I hasten to add).\n\nAnyway, this was a pretty awesome book and I learned so much more about apartheid than I had any idea about, and what it is like to be born into a society where you just don't quite fit.\n\nTrevor has a great admiration for his mother, but I think he is pretty incredible himself, considering where he started from.\n\nHighly recommended read from me.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211091", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The way it \"sees\" things that are it the way is amusing. My kids enjoy watching it work.\n\nPros:\nHe will avoid large objects.\n\nYou do not have to have a completely \"picked up\" house for him to clean.  He will work his way around shoes, books,  and fairly large things.\nHe will not drive off the stairs.\n\nYou do not need special \"walls\" to trap him or keep him out of a room.  Just close the door, or put something in front of the area you want him to avoid.\nStuff he will pick up off of laminate: Cheerios, small wrappers, pills, fluff, popcorn kernels, old dried peas (you can see what we have on the floor).\n\nCleans flat floors well (laminate, tile).\n\nCan work his way out of being trapped (usually).\n\nIs very quiet, not annoying at all.\n\nI have a run time of about 1.5 hours on laminate flooring.\n\nThe side brushes get stuff from along the edges of the room.\n\nCons:\nThe directions say that the base must have nothing in front of it for 6 feet or to either side for 5 feet.  Really?  Who has an outlet with that meets those specifications that is not also where you usually walk? The good news is that I tried it with objects on both sides, and although this does somewhat diminish the chances that he will find his home again to recharge, he still usually finds his way back.\n\nIt will push around some objects, or even larger ones where there is little friction.  I turned around one time to find him pushing a rolling chair (on laminate) and he will push short flat objects that are too short for him to see (like a pair of scissors) around.  Where there is more friction (on a carpet) he will push over some objects. He pushed over a lightweight lamp (weighs 18 oz) of my daughter's, which has fiber optic strands at the top and then he chewed on the strands and broke some of them.\n\nDoes not do that well with vacuuming the carpet, the same stuff that he will pick up often gets left behind (small wrappers) on the carpet.  I imagine this is due to the larger amount of friction between the object and the carpet.\n\nThe absolute biggest con is that he cannot be programmed to start cleaning at a certain time each day.  When they say \"set the hom-bot for scheduled automatic cleaning\" what they mean is that you can push a button on the remote to tell it to clean later.  You CANNOT set it up to say, clean at 9am every day.  The description says \"Just set the schedule according to the hour, day, week and even month you want Hom-Bot to go to work, and Voice Alert announcements will let you know when the scheduled cleaning is complete.\" but I did not find anywhere in the instructions that explained how to do this.\n\nMine did not come with a microfiber mop, as listed in the description, but I doubt I would use it anyway.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "211101", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

This can be explained as this volume is a collection of solo stories done (I presume) to give Mr Anderson relief while he works on the longer arcs.  Collected from 2014, 2015 and 2016 are Astro City # 17, #22, #25, #27-28 and #31.\n\nThe artists included are a very International group with Spanish Artist Jesus Merino doing half of the stories.  While Australian Artist Gary Chaloner does one and the then two Artists working out of Canada each do one story apiece Tom Grummett and Joe Infurnari.\n\nThe thing I feel makes Astro City such a success is the characters are grounded in the real world and that  the stories usually involve an Epic Saga taking place over many years. Instead of the usual superhero comic which usually covers just a few hours in the hero's life.\n\nIn the first story Sorrowsday we find out that the magically appearing \"red cake\" which arrives every year is linked to a very strange mystery.  We also get the death of an Honor Guard member.\n\nThe next story Hero's Reward is a Starfighter story and my favorite of the collection. It has echoes of John Carter on Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nLucky Girl is also excellent focusing on the life of Hummingbird. The 4th story Game Over was my least favorite. I didn't really like the \"cutesy\" American Chibi or Infurnari's art for that matter.\n\nThings bounce back to excellent for the fifth story by Gary Chaloner. It features Wolf Spider and a group of Australian Superheroes.  We close out the collection with Nightmare Life about the Living Nightmare.\n\nWe also get all the beautiful Alex Ross painted covers plus a 12 page sketchbook featuring character designs by Alex and the other pencilers.\n\nMy Highest Recommendation.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211102", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It's well written, funny and hot romance where a MMA fighter and a cop meets a doctor, a woman from his past.\n\nPlot:\n\nChrissy, a doctor who has been working all over the globe at different catastrophe areas, is returning to her hometown to bale out her brother from the prison. She has estranged relationship with Slade. They used to be very close, until the day, their father died. Still, whenever Slade, the MMA fighter, is in trouble, he calls Chrissy, his only living family.\n\nOn her way to the jailhouse, she is stopped by a police officer. To her surprise, the cop is the best friend of Chrissy's brother. When Jack recognizes Chrissy, sparks fly! There is a history between Chrissy and Jack, and even there is a lot of attraction in the play, there are obstacles. Jack has always seen Chrissy as a little sister (at least until they meet again) and Chrissy doesn't like the idea Jack being a MMA fighter like her brother is and Jack is also well-known player. These things doesn't fit into Chrissy's plans.\n\nCharacters:\n\nI liked Chrissy because she was independent and strong woman. I did not understand few things about her though and there were times where I couldn't relate to her. Her constant complaining and worry about MMA fights remained a mystery for me. I did understand that she was worried about her brother, but her overly strong stand against legal fights was a mystery for me. How can a woman who is working with heavily injured people daily, be so overwhelmingly nervous? I didn't understand that. She seemed little whiny when it came to what her brother did for living.\n\nI loved Jack for several reasons. The biggest reason is probably how he cared for both Chrissy and Slade. I loved the close relationship between Jack and Slade and how Jack was the voice of reason for Slade.\n\nI also enjoyed the relationship dynamics between Jack and Chrissy.\n\nI would like to add, that the supporting characters were a lot of fun to read about! They gave a lot of added value to the book. I loved Slade and I am glad, that the second book in the series is about him! But all the other guys from the WtF Academy were enjoyable and well-written. The dialogues between the guys made me laugh out loud several times, the bickering was great!\n\nOh, and I simply must say, that the whole Chihuahua story line was awesome!\n\nGenerally:\n\nAll in all, it was a fun book to read. Well-written and enjoyable plot, interesting characters, hot romance.

It looks like it's filmed through a dirty bar glass that a hobo just spit in. The guys in the movie look legitimately like they've all seen a lot of prison time. The humor in the movie is cruel, racist, and never intentionally funny for the reasons they are hoping for. It's also bizarrely loopy with it's morality. Murder is ok. Blasphemy is encouraged. Killing 1000 priests makes up for millions dead in the Holocaust. Oh and towards the last 3rd of the film, you learn about the healing powers of the Catholic church and the grace of Jesus Christ, which I agree completely with this last bit about Jesus.\n\nDespite all the above, the movie is bizarrely watchable and will stick with you as an utter mess. Apparently, even the crazy auteur of this film Duke Mitchell didn't even want to release it. Goodness knows what all he left on the floor. However, his wishes were not appeased after his death and much like Vladimir Nabokov's Original of Laura we got a nuclear mess on the hands of trash film lovers that's hard to ignore.  Yeah, it's disgusting, the sound is off, and the plot makes zero sense. The same time, it's oddly endearing and while they can't seem to make up their minds about whether you should be a decent person or not, They have a weird Hallmark Movie moment involving conversion to Christianity. It's a bit like your surly teen that in the end just wants attention.

Pit Posse advertises is as a lift for motorcycles and ATV's, but I'll probably use it for transmissions.  The jack specs have been painted over but it appears to be the size of a 2 to 3 ton jack.  The metal lift structure built around the jack is a \"scissor\" mechanism that extends from a bottom of 13 1/2 inches to a maximum height of 34 1/2 inches.  The rectangular rubber covered platform is 13 3/4 inches by 16 inches with a rectangular hole in the middle.  The maximum load that can be lifted is 300 pounds.  The stand is painted black and comes with two retaining hooks to help stabilize what you are lifting.  It arrived in a 70 pound box, fully assembled with the exception of the foot pedal jack control.  Unfortunately, the pedal rod was about a 1/4 inch too long and bottomed out in the jack handle sleeve before the retaining bolts holes aligned.  Accordingly, I cut off about a 1/2 inch off the end of the rod and everything lined up.  Other than that, the stand seems to work well and is reasonably constructed.\n\nThe one main concern I have is safety.  Remember the higher a load is lifted, the more top heavy it becomes.  It wouldn't take much to tip it over, especially when rolling it around.  If a wheel hits one little bump the lift can easily tilt and fall over.  The designer really needs to add some kind of support legs that can be extended to increase the width of the lift support base.  The bottom support stand has holes for a retaining rod that locks the lift height at four different levels to prevent height creep from jack leakage and sudden drops from jack failure.  You should always use this safety feature while working.  Overall, the stand is reasonably priced and functioned as advertised, but be careful using it with heavy loads...five stars.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211123", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I would have liked to see more in the building of their relationship. And I would have liked a bit more historical description of the place and times, to put me more into the story.

This sexy couple will take you on a wild ride through the streets of Victorian London where mystery and adventure collide!\n\nPhaeton Black is a man of many talents. As a paranormal investigator with uncanny abilities, he solves the most unusual crimes for Scotland Yard. Yet he's also a generous lover that enjoys seducing his fair share of wicked women. When a young attractive female holds a knife to his throat and demands he make love to her, more than Phaeton's curiosity is aroused. He quickly realizes Miss America Jones is a sexy distraction that is more addictive than absinthe. He is searching for a fanged villain that drinks its victims' blood and she's hot on the trail of the man that stole her father's ships. Together, they form an unlikely pair of investigators searching for clues one minute and exploring their explosive passion the next. As the adventure unfolds, attractions grow strong and danger lurks at every corner. Yet the greatest danger Phaeton and America face may be the risk of losing their hearts.\n\nTHE SEDUCTION OF PHAETON BLACK is a fun and absolutely thrilling read. Think Sherlock Holmes only with some paranormal craziness, a female companion and a bit more erotic! This novel is all that and more. Ms Stone pulls together a truly exciting read with great characters, powerful plot lines and fabulous drama. Then of course there are the steampunk elements that really make this a unique and worthwhile read.\n\nPhaeton is the scandalously bad leading man...but in a desirable way. You can tell right away he is the kind of man that will leave a woman satisfied yet begging for more. He does not mince words and says exactly what is on his mind, which can lead to some hilarious moments concerning his lustful thoughts. Miss Jones throws him for a loop though. So there is some pleasure to be derived from seeing this poor character squirm under the prospect of change because of one woman. He keeps his life neat and clean of attachments and as America launches herself into his life, you see the small transformations of this deliciously attractive man. While these changes may drive him crazy, he becomes even more irresistible to America.\n\nAmerica is definitely a different kind of leading lady. She is a fantastically unique and independent spirit. As the daughter of a New Orleans witch and an English sea captain, you can expect nothing less. She fought with everything she had when a fight presented itself and she loved with all her heart when the right man came into her life. Love is a foreign word to Mr. Black and America has the patience of a saint waiting for him to wake up and see the reality of what they share. America is an amazing character because she gave as much love as she could give, but never demanded anything in return. You not only want to root for her, but gain a large amount of respect her character.\n\nStill, here's the disclaimer...if you're looking for the sweeping romance with the steampunk background, this may not be everything you want. While Phaeton and America may start building on a relationship in this novel, things aren't perfect between them. Which makes sense since this is the first in a series that will continue to follow these two extravagant characters. So the romance does move a bit slower than fans may like.\n\nTHE SEDUCTION OF PHAETON BLACK is incredibly erotic...so much so it's a wonder you can hold the book and not scorch your fingers. Both characters share a passionate nature and attraction that seems to become more overwhelming each time they are together. Ms Stone does a great job of molding their relationship, but I would have appreciated a few more `sweet moments' contributing to a fulfilling romance.\n\nFans of the steampunk genre will not be disappointed in THE SEDUCTION OF PHAETON BLACK. Jillian Stone starts off a promising series with eccentric characters Phaeton Black and America Jones who will take you on one heck of an adventure. Not only does this novel have a thrilling plot, but also an erotic romance that will knock your socks off! Ms Stone has definitely started a series that is going in the right direction and has all the right elements for a bright future.\n\nLisa Jo @ The Romance Reviews\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "211147", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I plan to read many more because I enjoyed this one so much.\n\nHannah lives with a secret that she has shared with no one. It's amazing how one secret can affect so many people but this story illustrates just how that can happen.\n\nHannah grows up with Samuel and Christian who are best friends. Samuel leaves their Amish community without warning but leaves a note behind saying goodbye. Hannah and Christian get married and attempt to start a family when tragedy strikes, threatening to reveal her secret.\n\nThis is not your typical \"feel good\" Amish novel. It brings up real-life situations that can, and do, happen and the harsh consequences of our decisions. Because of some bad choices we make, we can struggle with shame, remorse and many more heartbreaking emotions. Fortunately, this story also focuses on forgiveness and trusting in God. If you make it through this book with dry eyes, you are much tougher than me.\n\nI highly recommend this novel to anyone wanting a closer relationship with God or desiring to learn the importance of forgiveness.\n\nI received an audio version of this story from the author in exchange for an honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211151", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Witty and over the top, it was a great showcase for Reese Witherspoon, with an engaging group of supporting characters.  I guess if they had tried to follow up the success of the equally ditzy/funny \"Clueless\" movie, they would have not succeeded, and they didn't here, either.\n\nIt feels as though this movie was named first...\"Red, White and Blonde\", and then someone found a screenwriter who was willing to sacrifice their craft to come up with something, anything that would match the title.  They chose to move Elle to Washington, D.C., for a little \"Mr. Smith, Mr. Deeds\" action -- this time the crusade being for animal rights.  Director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld was successful with \"Kissing Jessica Stein\", but proves he can't direct what might have been a \"for laughs\" comedy.  All kinds of things get in the way, such as the\nfar-fetched warming of a curmudgeonly woman senator, who warms to Elle just because they were both Delta Nu's.  There is a sidebar to the animal portion of the story that deals with the sexual persuasion of Elle's chihuahua that was definitely not needed.\n\nThere are some satirical bits, some great costumes, the incomparable Bob Newhart, and a game performance by Reese Witherspoon, who should be telling her agent...\"absolutely not!\" to a third run at Elle Woods.  We'll see.\n\nRent, don't buy!\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "211155", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review. Only output the score and nothing else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Review:\nIt is no secret that our society today is largely an unhealthy one -- pardon the large pun.  We are fat, we suffer from depression, cancers are killing young and old alike, and we eat on the run from fast-food vendors.  The two leading causes of death for men, as listed by the Center for Disease Control (2008) were heart disease and cancer.  Those two led unintentional injuries, chronic respiratory diseases, and stroke by an overwhelming margin.  The top killers for women (2008) are identical, leading stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, and Alzheimer's by an overwhelming margin.\n\nBut Dr. James Marcum makes the case in his new book, \"Medicines that Kill\", that those CDC-named top killers actually be a distant second to an even more lethal one: Medicine.  It sounds strange that a medical doctor would point accusing fingers at an element of the medical field, but it only lends him credibility.\n\nREAL-LIFE EXAMPLES: Dr. Marcum gave numerous real-life examples throughout the book of the pitfalls of medications. Consider Brenda's story.  She's 43 years old, stands 5'4\", and carries 295 pounds.  She revealed to him how overwhelmed she had become.  She lost her marriage because her husband became an alcoholic.  She began eating and gaining weight, so her blood pressure increased.  As a result of a prescription to lower blood pressure, her legs swelled.  So she was prescribed a diuretic, which negatively reacted with the previous blood pressure medication.  On and on the story goes until Brenda is prescribed a whopping 16 medications, all combating problems onset by prior medications.\n\nDr. Marcum helped Brenda evaluate her life and its trajectory, took her through a series of medication step-downs, and she has conquered her initial weight gain, weighing half of her starting weight.  Marcum writes, \"Instead of funding weight-loss pills, how about promoting weight-loss programs?  Instead of sleeping pills, how about finding out why patients don't sleep well and getting at the cause rather than treating a symptom?  Instead of medicating pain, let's find out what is causing the pain?\" (p. 75)\n\nCONSIDERATIONS: Throughout the book, Dr. Marcum repeatedly asks his readers to consider first the root causes of the pain, and then to ask whether or not the sought-after medication is more harmful than the initial problem itself.  Additionally, he asks his readers to educate themselves on the harmful side-effects of medications.  He reminds his readers that we have grown too dependent upon medications, including the easy-to-obtain over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen and acetaminophen.\n\nHe writes, \"Having blind faith in pharmaceuticals is more than just dangerous -- it's naive.  Why would we ever think that medications can cure illnesses that develop as the result of a lifetime of bad habits?  Why would we look to a pill or a potion to dig us out of the physical or mental hole we've been digging, sometimes for decades? ... We're not overweight for lack of diet pills.  I have never seen someone with type 2 diabetes cured by a medication. ...  Sometimes we're sick because for many years we've lived unhealthy lifestyles and thought we could get away with it.\" (p. 29)\n\nIMPACT: After reading \"Medicines that Kill\" I was challenged in my own right to consider whether or not it was truly beneficial to consume vitamin I (Ibuprofen) as much as I do.  I have various aches and pains from years of beating my body at work and in the gym.  But after reading that one of my trusted stand-bys Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's) and Acetaminophen can be just as damaging to my liver as other doctor-prescribed medications.  The problem, is that these easy-to-obtain medicines (cold and headache medicines, for example) are just that: easy to obtain and uncontrolled.  I will reconsider next time I have a head or chest cold, or when my body aches.\n\n2 PARTS: The book is divided into two practical parts: The Problem, and The Solution.  The Problem tells the obvious issues associated with over-medicating, while The Solution presents his biblical approach to medicine.  He teaches a system of 7 laws -- good nutrition, exercise, water, sunlight, air, rest, and sabbath -- that he found tucked away in the 7 days of creation in Genesis.  Theologically, I found the 7 laws to be very loosely connected to those 7 days of creation, but \"Medicines that Kill\" was not intended to be a theological -- nor a scientific -- treatise.  Regardless of one's beliefs, Marcum appropriately encourages his readers to take control of their lives, to start focusing on right solutions, and eschewing the harmful ones.\n\nREADABILITY:  The book is easily readable by us medically untrained-types.  It's not a scientific treatise one would find in professional journals.  Marcum admits the scientific data and research are not there, but experience and logical observation supports his premises.  The stories are multiple and enlightening.\n\n\"Medicines the Kill\" is a new book that ought to be read by at least one member of every household.  Dr. James Marcum is the co-host of Heartwise Ministries.\n\nRATING: I give \"Medicines that Kill\" 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this book free of charge from Tyndale Blog Network (Tyndale House Publishers) in exchange for my unbiased review of it. All opinions are mine. I was not threatened or coerced to provide a positive review.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.88}, {"id": "211156", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

In The Forbidden, the battle of good and evil continues, picking up where the last novel, The Bitten, left off. In this episode, the team is splintered, deeply wounded, and exhausted (mentally, spiritually, and physically).  Their faith, confidence, and fortitude have been challenged during the last battle that literally took them to Hell and back.  Damali, herself, is wounded suffering from a terrible loss of her child and seeks direction from the Light.  In a desperate act, Damali, is summoned to the Council of Neterus.  It is here we gain history and insight into the fates of the Neterus that came before her - including the first, Eve.  It is also where Damali must answer to her despicable and damning walk on the dark side with her lover/husband, Carlos Rivera, as detailed in The Bitten.  She is counseled and disciplined severely. She is sent back ashamed, weaponless, separated from her team, but with a better understanding of the magnitude and recklessness of her lustful behavior.\n\nShe begins a slow and confusing road to redemption and must now reunite and rebuild her team, avenge her past sins, and regain favor and trust of her enlightened mother-sisters.  She must assist the resurrected Carlos in his transformation to become her equal counterpart, the male Neteru. They must put their egos aside and discover their destiny together while battling their most formidable foes to date:  Carlos's sire (Satan's son) and Satan's wife (Lillith) who has stolen something from Damali that is more precious than life itself.\n\nThis novel allows us to bid farewell to a few familiar characters and introduces fresh allies and enemies, discover new powers and abilities, and reinforces the purpose and vision for Damali and her team.  It offers a wonderfully imagined blend of ancient folklore, mythology, religion, and culture that works brilliantly.  Bank's creativity yields an epiphany for Damali and her readers because there were many \"a-ha\" moments.  The plot is intricate and suspenseful, the characters numerous and complex, and timing is superb - great writing all around.  The Forbidden sets the stage for more action, romance, and mystery - it is a wonderful chapter in a fantastic saga.

Loved it out of the box- very sexy little netbook, seemed like really good quality, glossy screen was beautiful! keyboard not bad at all for size. wasn't slow at all but we only used it for basic websurfing, email, that kind of thing. then about 1 month later, he goes to turn on the computer and lo and behold there is a menacing black blob on bottom left side of screen with black tentacles extending upwards in a spider's web to the top right of the screen! Looked like a crack but it seemed to be cracked on the INSIDE! The computer had not been dropped or hit or abused or misused in any way! Just had shut it down and put away the night before and everything was fine! well, in a panic I called Acer tech support only to be told that this (screen damage)is not covered under the warranty and was basically blamed for mistreating the computer. Tech told me it might cost $199 to replace screen and I'd have to cover shipping charges to get it to them! SO because Google is my friend, I looked it up and apparently this problem is not uncommon with these Acer netbooks! I also read that Acer KNOWS about this but still tries to blame customers for the problem! Well, long story short, did NOT send back to Acer- instead bought new screen (exact same model) on eBay for about $65 shipped and fixed it myself with help from online video. Netbook works great now, but we now as a rule DO NOT CLOSE LID WHILE COMPUTER IS ON EVEN IF PUTTING IN STANDBY!! It's thought by some that the heat from? battery or something is what caused the screen to crack. So please save yourself some money and some heartache and be careful with yours if you get one!\nP.S. When I uninstalled screen, found it was made by Samsung, so this may not be just an Acer problem.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211187", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Normally I'm more of a chocolate flavor purist, perhaps allowing peanuts (M&Ms) or almonds (Hershey bars) to be part of the mix, but until I tasted these chocolate eggs, the thought of mixing chocolate and fruit flavors grossed me out (e.g., cherry chocolates, etc.).\n\nAnyway, the combination of chocolate and orange flavors is heavenly.  I like the size, the shape, and the way they are put together.  AND, of course, the flavor.\n\nJust in case you are not familair with these already, the chocolate orange comes wrapped in a foil covering.  One end is covered with a sticker.  What you need to do before you open the wrapping is hold the egg in your hand and whack it down onto a solid surface on the end where the sticker is.  This action allows the sections of the chocolate orange to be easily pulled apart after you remove the wrapper.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic treat, and I try to be a good boy all year long in the hopes that there will be another one of these in my stocking come Christmas morning!\n\nMerry Christmas, and a 5-star treat!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "211189", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

But when she arrives, things change quickly with the Spanish flu epidemic and an unexpected situation involving four children. Will she be able to put her dreams on \"hold\" long enough to keep Arthur's interest and still fulfill her obligations to her aunt? Or will her dreams and plans be turned completely upside down by four children who have lost so much?\n\nDebut novel or not, this book was wonderful. I am always a  skeptic when it comes to books everyone raves about, because I'm afraid I'm not going to love it, and I'd feel bad giving a less than glowing review. But this book was so comfortable I felt like I was Rebekah, my dreams rising and falling with each passing day. You won't feel like you traveled or journeyed anywhere in this novel, because you're there, living and breathing through Rebekah's eyes, experiencing her disappointments and rejoicing at her successes. My only disappointment in this book is that it had to end...but that's inevitable, isn't it?\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "211215", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Although the narrative reveals many complexities -- such as an amazing array of aliens with exceedingly distinct biologies and natures, as well as intricately developed plotline -- one has to strain to translate what is on the page into a flowing \"mental movie.\" The characters speak in shorthand a lot. And descriptions of critical events can be ambiguous or vague. Reading these books is somewhat akin to arriving at a bridge across a chasm made of wooden slats where random planks are infirm or missing and one has to uncertainly tiptoe over certain sections and jump across others. The books also take their own sweet time in many a scene -- i.e., the languid reconnection between heroine biologist Mac and her wayward (but also heroine) friend, Emily, in REGENERATION's opening chapters -- and that can lead to reader impatience.\n\nHowever, the strangeness in the prose also companionably enriches the trilogy's theme of a human scientific woman's unasked-for immersion in extraterrestrial species' evolution, competition, and, yes, maturation cycles. Mac's struggle to stay on her bridge over the chasm (so to speak) -- or perhaps one should use the analogy \"keep her head above water\" since she administers the Norcoast Salmon Research Facility -- when she must deal with various races of the galactic Interspecies Union is keenly transmitted to the reader. So is her scholarly social awkwardness with her own kind, and her slowly blossoming romance with the mostly-absent cosmic spy, Nik. It takes reader investment to fully appreciate these SPECIES IMPERATIVE books (just as it does to know and imbibe a fine wine), but all three volumes are worth the effort.\n\nREGENERATION brings the perilous and yet, often comedic, mission of Dr. Mackensie Connor and her earthly and unearthly friends (Oversight and Fourteen are among my favorite friends; they are each gratingly adorable in their own inimitable ways) to a nail-biting finale and a resolution that a salmon-cycle researcher would find befitting. This isn't a stand-alone though. Read the trilogy in order. If you are starting now, you won't have to wait on pins and needles for release of the next installment like I did.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211229", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I saw this film at its New York City premiere a few years ago, in a theater in Greenwich Village, and Mr. Davidson was in the audience. He answered a number of questions after the film was over. While some efforts are being made to address the horrific situation of pre-teenagers working under dangerous health conditions in the Bolivian silver mines, nowhere near enough funding is available to prevent this enormously saddening practice from continuing.\n\nThe sight of miners--boys and men alike--walking maskless in and through clouds of mineral dust is truly horrifying. Then when you realize that some of these boys are as young as 12 years old, it's even worse. This scenario, when juxtaposed with miners praying to various statues of the devil--most festooned with flowers, food, and other items of thanks--is almost too bizarre to be believed, especially given the devout Catholicism of the population. But in the mines of Bolivia, the devil is, for better or worse, the chief deity--it is he who holds sway over the daily lives of the miners who, if they live past the age of 40, are considered lucky indeed.\n\nThe main character in the film is a 14-year old boy who with his 12-year old brother works in these mines to put food on the table for his broken family (the father is not in the household). He goes to school with his brother and hopes for a better future, but it's relatively clear, seeing the film, that this is really a dim kind of hope.\n\nThe Devil's Miner brings to light one of the most tragic plights of people living in poverty in various parts of the world. It's interesting to compare this with a feature film, Blind Shaft, set in China, about two miners who perpetrate a murderous scam to make money additional to their work.\n\nThis is a superior film, very highly recommended.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211230", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The realness in the words, the sufferings of the character and the sometimes harsh words they spoke are honest and raw.\n\nKade knows how to shape his character that they are pleasant but with full of edges, nothing is really smooth about them. The rough and heavy things the character in general but also this two guys of this book show are remarkable.\n\nJeremy and Carter truly set themself in your heart. You are eager to get to know these guys, you are captivated but the rough words, by the behaviour towards the other person in the book and what happened.\n\nJeremy is one character you have to decode first, but under the surface there lies so much, so much depth but also vulnerability. Its incredible how well you like him after a while.\n\nCarter is a differnt kind of guy compared to Jeremy but nontheless he is interesting. He hasn't the obvious edges like Jeremy but he isn't also pure innocence, despite the fact he developed his feelings late for Jeremy.\n\nA lot of mixed feelings are in and between the book, a lot of angst is built on this and makes things complicated. Though the title says Simple Things there aren't any of them for a long time but even with all the heavy aspects the book has a really cute and charming happy end after. :3\n\nIf you love realness, honesty and rough character you will love this book.\n\nJeremy and Carter have a chemistry which is undoubtly, which is settled and you know both fit well together though they seem so different.

Note that you wouldn't typically get this for your first 18650 flashlight - you want something with a general purpose beam - unless you really only need one to illuminate long distances.

There are two detents - generally you press all the way down to turn on or off, or press half way to choose the mode, with submodes to start in the lowest or highest mode directly. I also like the clip since it can be used both directions so you can attach the light to a hat brim to use as a headlamp.\n\nI got the version with two 16340 batteries since I already have enough 18650 batteries and needed some 16340 for other torches. You need an 18650 for this light, though. The 16340s that comes with this bundle provide only 1400mah total - you would much rather have a 3400mah 18650. Plus, the flashlight will only charge 18650 batteries.\n\nGet a good quality 3400mah version (better yet, two, for those long weekends!) by a reputable brand like Nitecore, Orbtronic ,Eagletac, Zebralight, Olight, Fenix - whatever is cheapest since all these have a Panasonic or Sanyo cell inside with a protection circuit shrink wrapped to it.  Don't buy from disreputable distributors that inflate the mAh by 3x or more (cough- those with Sun or Fire in the name- cough.)  You can actually use unprotected cells in good quality flashlights since they have good regulation, and save a lot of money, but get protected cells anyway.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "211245", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

This is book 1 of the Bridal Veil Island series by Tracie Peterson and Judith Miller.\n\nWith the combination of mystery, romance, drama - To Have and To Hold never had a dull moment. With a diverse range of characters from a cranky southern-to-the-core \"aunt\" to a widowed doctor - Peterson and Miller had a lot of personalities to combine for conflict, drama, friendship, and romance. Some of the novel, like the romance, was pretty predictable, but I'm not sure how that could have been changed since we were seeing the story through both of their eyes. The suspense around the construction site filled the story out and will give the book a broader range of interested readers. Also, there were enough twists and turns, enough misunderstandings and stubborn personalities to keep it interesting and charming. Honestly I've always cared more about the story than about the historical accuracy. Since reading this book, I've read more about the work that goes into making these stories fit the time period and I am impressed!\n\nDisclosure: I received the book free from Bethany House Book Reviewers' program.

Jake Heggie is a wonderfully lyrical composer. He really knows how to show off the voice and has an innate sense of drama. He also proves a brilliant orchestrator. The duet on forgiveness in the second act is very moving...as is the music for Von Stade. Occasionlly the opera goes a bit over the top, particularly at the end of the first act, where Sister Helen seems to be having a psychotic break...seems a bit much. But more often the piece is pretty understated for an opera and the ending is extremely effective.\nSo why only three stars? I think the problem rests with the libretto. This opera continues the deplorable late 20th century trend in opera toward sung play. As opera houses move toward commissioning playwrites such as McNally and William Hoffman as librettists the things that distiguish the particular art of the librettist are dying out. This opera libretto reads like a play. While there are a few ensembles that attempt to present multiple viewpoints simulteneously, they don't compare to the great ensemble situations of a Da Ponte or Boito. And perhaps more importantly, though McNally does include soliloquies, they are in a rather straightforward prose...one that is hard to set well in music. Too many syllables and too little verbal rhythm. As a result, no matter how hard Heggie struggles (and he does a heroic job at this) the opera never bursts into song, as it obviously wants to. Some will say that this is because the opera is throughcomposed, as is the style in modern opera. While that's true, you only have to listen to the operas of Barber or Carlisle Floyd to here examples of throughcomposed opera that still retains the sense of song. Even Nixon in China manages to create a sense of song while remaining throughcomposed.\nPerhaps the difference is that in the most successful contemporary opera libretti, the librettist is either the composer, or a poet. In many ways, the best choice for a modern librettist is to follow the practice of Broadway and let the dialogue be written by a playwrite, reserving the set pieces (and most operas still have set pieces, even Britten) for a poet or lyricist. Certainly, this would have helped this opera to do what opera can do best, soar.\nHard to review this one. I like it, but with reservations.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211261", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

From this perspective reading this book was a failure.  I felt like the last guy on the block to get the joke, as I didn't realize this was a spoof until I got about fifteen pages into the book.\n\nBut the author doesn't stop at miligning only Fillmore.  He chooses a large array of targets, and the early 1800's are one of the funniest.  He describes life in that time in such a way, that I often was laughing out loud.\n\nThe footnotes were often hilarious.  In talking about the electoral college, he raposts \"the fact that classes ...convene only once every four years has led to its reputation as a party school.\"\n\nOr a hamlet-\"To qualify as a hamlet a community had to have at least one unique superstition founded on either sneezing animals, the consumption of meat before sleeping, or the flight of sparrows on a windy day.\"\n\nOr Fillmore himself-\"It has largely been suggestedby presidential psychiatrists that Fillmore suffered from the verbal phenomenon known as 'cognitive ignorance'\".\n\nThe author brings Fillmore to life in much the same way as a creation between the historical soldier Flashman and Forest Gump.\n\nOpening Chapter 7, the author quotes Fillmore \"Buffalo in the springtime, is as I imagine heaven to be, although with more precipitation and fewer cherubs.\"\n\nThis hilarious and often inane depiction of our 13th president kept me laughing.  He intersperses his imagination of what the anti-hero is really like with the historical events of his times.\n\nInterestingly enough, revisionist historians now take a much more moderate view of Fillmore.  He is considered to be a temperate president who took a studied conciliation between the abolitionists and the pro-slavery factions, and averted an earlier civil war.\n\nThis book is often cruel to Fillmore, even maligning his wife's death, the day after he left office.  While the events that Fillmore encountered are for most part factual, the author makes some bizarre interpretations.  If they are read in good fun, it is worth the read.\n\nIt is worth a perusal, but read it when your mind is clear, so you can fully appreciate the bizarre humor of this author.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211262", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It holds a little bit of cleaner wax, does what your toddler would do, runs out of fluid, and stops.  Then you have to refill it a few more times and then it runs out of battery.  Charge.  Repeat.

D.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of this 302-page book (total pages) is that there is only 134 pages of text.  There is an 18 page bibliography (pages 279-297), and there is a 138-page \"Sources and Notes, Clarifications and Amplifications\" section (pages 139-277).  There is no index.\n\nJust a note here on the \"Sources and Notes. . .\" section: Shenk uses 134 pages of text to make his case, and it is engrossing reading.  But, if you think \"Sources and Notes\" would be a long, tedious, boring section of the book, you would be sadly mistaken here.  For each and every assertion that Shenk makes in his argument (we'll get to that in a moment), he has a source or note to verify it.  This is a highly researched, evidence specific, thoroughly developed argument that is worth every minute you spend with it.\n\nIf you are looking for a motivational book that will support all that you do in life, this is where to start.  If you think for one moment that you are limited by the genes with which you were born, think again.  Shenk claims your genetic heritage may account for only about 50% of your talent, and the other 50% is determined by nurture and your environment.  What you do, and how you feel about what you do matters.\n\nIf I was looking for support for all of the motivational essays, speeches, articles, and books I have written throughout the years (See, AND THEN SOME WORKS), this would be the book -- and the evidence.  What Shenk is saying is that the intensity of your motivation, ambition, persistence, and self-discipline are not genetically determined but are shaped by nurture and environment.  Just as you teach children how to take responsibility for their lives, you, too, can have a direct, sustained, ongoing, positive, and productive influence on your own talent and ability.  This is good news, and if you don't believe it, read this book, and bathe in the evidence that supports his assertions.\n\nAll of the books that have been (and are being) written on neuroplasticity -- \"[the] term referring to the ability of the brain and nervous system in all species to change structurally and functionally as a result of input from the environment\" -- gain support from Shenk's work.  Shenk makes the case for the plasticity of intelligence.\n\nShenk explains how genes really work, that intelligence is a process not a thing, that talents are not innate gifts \"but the result of a slow, invisible accretion of skills,\" as well as how to be a genius, how to inspire children, how to foster cultural excellence, and how to improve your genes.  This is an amazing book!\n\nHaving been an advocate of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work on flow, I was delighted to find Shenk referring to Csikszentmihalyi: \" . . . intelligence isn't fixed.  Intelligence isn't general.  Intelligence is not a thing.  Intelligence is a dynamic, diffuse, and ongoing process.  This finding fits perfectly with the earlier work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and colleagues, who concluded that `high academic achievers are not necessarily born `smarter' than others, but work harder and develop more self-discipline'\" (p. 42).\n\nWhether you are a supporter of the interactionist perspective or not, the book will introduce you to the way genius is made.  That is especially interesting to read.\n\nI think the author made a superb decision to separate his argument and the evidence used to support his argument.  He is an excellent writer, and 134 pages may be all you have to read.  I have found that the more technical you become by incorporating all your evidence and references within your narrative turns off more readers than it encourages.  Shenk's argument is so well presented, so smoothly offered, and so effective that it should be readable by a large audience -- especially, I might add, educators.  Educators are often those prone to picking out and doting upon their brighter students.  After reading and absorbing what Shenk has to say may make them think twice about this approach.\n\nThe use of examples such as David Beckham, Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods, as well as Friedrich Nietzsche, Beethoven, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was delightful information.\n\nBecause of Shenk's argument, and because of his emphasis on the interaction between genes, nurture, and environment, I loved the following paragraph: \"For deliberate practice to work, the demands have to be serious and sustained.  Simply playing lots of chess or soccer or golf isn't enough.  Simply taking lessons from a wonderful teacher is not enough.  Simply wanting it badly enough is not enough.  Deliberate practice requires a mind-set of never, ever, being satisfied with your current ability.  It requires a constant self-critique, a pathological restlessness, a passion to aim consistently just beyond one's capability so that daily disappointment and failure is actually desired, and a never-ending resolve to dust oneself off and try again and again and again\" (p. 55).  Talk about motivation to excel!\n\nNow, after writing a paragraph like that, Shenk offers a realistic assessment of what it takes to excel: \"It also requires enormous, life-altering amounts of time--a daily grinding commitment to becoming better.  In the long term, the results can be highly satisfying.  But in the short term, from day to day and month to month, there's nothing particularly fun about the process or the substantial sacrifices involved\" (p. 55).  Do you wonder why the information in this book -- even when read by those seemingly committed to change -- is likely to go in one ear and out the other?\n\nOh well.  Even if you are familiar with the ideas here, even if you wave off social-science research as bogus, and even if you believe that talent comes primarily from genetic inheritance, this book is a good read.  Shenk makes you think -- and that's a healthy thing to do whether you agree or disagree with him.

I felt that the book left us at a good stopping point, although others may want more of their eventual story.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "211273", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

(The stereotype of the lonely spinster bothered me at first, but I was willing to let it slide because of the interesting twist of the main character falling in love with a whole family).\n\nNora begins to believe that maybe there is still a chance that through the Shahid's she can somehow fulfil her dreams and have the interesting life she always thought she would. She allows herself to get swept up in these fantasies until reality inevitably intrudes and she is forced to face the truth about her own neediness and delusions.\n\nNora has more spark than most of Brookner's heroines and she is a much more well-rounded character. I can't really understand why so many people think she is unlikeable. It's clear that in her outward life she is a decent person with friends who care about her and students who adore her. We, as readers, get to see past the faade she puts on for the world, and into her darkest fears and obsessions. Who among us would come out smelling of roses if our masks were stripped away and our true selves revealed?\n\nOne of the things I like best about this novel is its psychological realism. Nora to me is a very believable character and this is far more important than whether she is likeable or not. Her ambivalence about what she wants from life has been shaped by her mother's repressed anger at her own stifled existence. In trying to avoid her mother's fate Nora created her own cage, in the same way that she creates tiny boxes in her art. She lacked the courage to pursue her dream of being an artist, but at the same time she knows she is too honest to fit into the pretentious art world that the duplicitous Sirena slides into so easily. She is on the margins in every sense and Messud has done an excellent job of exploring the rage and impotence of a woman \"of a certain age\" who finds that she is becoming invisible.\n\nThere's much more to this book than this though, and I'll be mulling over its themes about art and identity and gender for a long time to come. The ending when Nora decides that she is no longer going to be the meek \"woman upstairs\" was very un-Brookner like and I was glad to see her finally own her rage. It finished on a note of hope that Nora is going to live life on her own terms and find the hidden symbol of joy that was always there in her art works for those who looked closely enough to find it.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211285", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

As his seneschal, she has done everything she can to keep him happy and content.  Byrne fears his darker warrior side, fears that one day he will snap.  Now, he is prepared to give up his role as suzerain after the tournament.  But someone else had very dark plans, plans that could destroy more than just Byrne and Jayr....\n\nLynn Viehl integrates the world of the vampire with tales of old to produce some very interesting results.  In EVERMORE, the myths and legends of Robin Hood and Sherwood Forest are explored.  At first, the emphasis on the past was a bit distracting, almost boring at times.  However, as the storyline built, it became quite intriguing.  The ending was exceptionally satisfying.\n\nJayr and Byrne are two of the more likable characters Lynn Viehl has created.  I initially enjoyed this series when it started with Michael Cyprien and Alexandra Keller, both of whom play a large role in this book.  However, later characters tended to grate a bit for me.  Jayr is by far one of Ms. Viehl's best characters to date.  Not only is Jayr willing to give it all for love, but she also refuses to be treated differently because she is a female serving in the traditionally male role of seneschal.  Byrne, too, is an excellent character, a man who struggles with his warrior nature and wants to protect others from himself.\n\nThe Darkyn series should be read in order.  Without a doubt, the characters and plotlines continue to weave in and out of the series and there are numerous things that only make sense when read in the context of the series as a whole. While some aspects of EVERMORE do stand alone, the complexities of Darkyn society and the various relationships are much better understood if one has read the prior books.\n\nEVERMORE is not a book that will appeal to all.  Lynn Viehl provides a unique approach to the vampire theme, one that is at times gritty and even quite brutal.  Lynn Viehl shows once again that she has a flair for taking chances with her writing.\n\nCOURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211291", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I put in 3 or 4 ice cubes in each bottle and let them sit in my kitchen at about 80some degrees for 3 hours. When I came back I dumped the contents out into cups to check how melted the ice was. The Nathan bottle was the clear winner with a chunk of ice still left over while the Polar bottle left a tiny sliver of ice that melted completely within 20 seconds in the cup.\n\nI found the Polar Bottle for $7 and the Nathan bottle for $8 in my local tj maxx store but I don't know if they're available anywhere else like walmart. I knocked a star because while I love that this bottle more than keeps my drink cold while my time in the gym, and I love the self sealing valve (which feels like nice soft silicone), it does produce a bit of condensation but nothing major. Also, it leaks a tiny bit, but again, nothing bad. Since it's still new, I do kind of taste a bit of plastic, but I don't mind. That said, I like the way it feels in my hand. The size is comfortable to hold.\n\nI will definitely be keeping this bottle and will return the Polar one, despite its bigger capacity. It's also cool that it's reflective. I do recommend this bottle and try to find it in stores first before you buy here and run your own experiment!\n\n*update* a few days later and I barely realized that the valve opens and closes! lol, the grey part with the arrows. If you want more flow, keep it open to the left, where the purple area on the cap shows an open lock symbol. close it to the right to shut it. Because of how the valve is, I don't need to close it, nothing leaks out even when tipped upside down. The way water comes out is by sucking it out lol!\n\nAlso, I don't really know why sometimes it insulates better than others. One day it took 5 hours for 8 ice cubes to completely melt. As you can see in the last 2 pictures, after an hour and a half, you can see how much ice was left. I guess it has to do with the outside temperature and humidity. My gym is in the lower 70 degrees, so that helps slow the melting. Yet another day, the 4 cubes melted at the end of my hour-long workout. Anyway, the last picture shows the ice after 3.5 hrs.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211295", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Now that I've started a different series, I was able to go back and reread \"Sebastian\" by itself.\n\nFirst, a caveat. This may be a Christian novel, but it contains language I know many Christian readers will find offensive. Just so you know what I'm talking about, I'll say there's one vulgar term for a male puppy, multiple uses of the three-letter word for a donkey, and one near-blasphemy where someone yells \"Jesus!\" but then saves it by following up with an exasperated prayer.\n\nNow, I had to ask myself, why did I give this novel four stars instead of five? I like the world Pratola's created, and I enjoyed the brotherly banter between Jett and Sebastian. I especially liked how Jett went about finding out what was wrong with Haven. Despite being a total control freak, he's a coward when it comes to his wife. He needed someone to put him in his place, and I was glad to see him and Haven end up together.\n\nBut Sebastian and Natalie...\n\nAll right. Putting all that \"soulmate\" nonsense aside (since it was totally blown out of the water in the third book), let's look at this in the light of normal human relationships. Sebastian is enslaved to his lusts and fornicates with multiple women, sometimes with more than one at the same time. No wonder Natalie is disgusted.\n\nThen he meets the girl who's supposedly his life mate, gets saved, and we're suppose to believe he's free from his addiction and completely trustworthy from that point on. But why should we? Natalie doesn't believe it. Something inside her (the Holy Spirit, perhaps?) warns her that once his initial lust for her is satisfied, Sebastian will return to his manwhoring ways.\n\nI think that's why I found this book so dissatisfying. Sebastian never does anything to prove he's reformed. We're suppose to accept it because it's what we're told. But all I'm seeing is a man with the hots for a woman he can't have.\n\nI guess there are some who can accept Sebastian and Natalie as a HEA. I'd like to accept it. But there's this thing niggling at me. That's why four stars instead of five. A five-star romance leaves me in tears of joy, and as much as I want to accept the ending of \"Sebastian,\" it left me with too many doubts to be truly happy about it.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211311", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The Parable of the Lily, written by Liz Curtis Higgs and illustrated by Nancy Munger, is a lively, engaging story about a girl named Maggie who receives a mysterious gift shortly after Christmas. It looks like just a box of dirt to her. Not understanding what it really is, she puts the box in the cellar with the other gardening items. When the weather gets warmer, and her father is working in the garden, Maggie knocks the box off from the cellar shelf in her haste to get her gardening tools. She spills the dirt, and a flower bulb that was buried in the dirt, onto the floor. When she cleans the mess up, she tosses dirt and all outside into the yard. Several weeks later, when she wakes up on Easter morning, she finds out how special the gift really is. A beautiful Easter lily is blooming in her garden.\n\nAlthough The Parable of the Lily isn't about Jesus' death and resurrection, there are Bible verses interspersed throughout the text that connect what's happening in the story to life of Jesus. The bright, colorful illustrations help convey the story line.\n\nWhat I like: I liked the whole book. The story was written well and the illustrations helped enhance the story line.\n\nWhat I dislike: Nothing.\n\nOverall Rating: Excellent.\n\nAge Appeal: 3 - 7.\n\nChristine M.

Both Mel and Sly make Their characters Far more Likeable, and in Doing so, they Lose what made the Originals Classic films.\nSly's Carter is a Vegas Debt Collector who heads off to Seattle when his Brother Mysteriously dies. He meets a Lot of Sordid Characters on his little Holiday, including Miranda Richardson as Gloria Carter, Sly's Brothers Wife, Rachel Leigh Cook as Doreen Carter, Gloria's Daughter, the Wonderfully Smug Alan Cumming as Computer Genius Jeremy Kinnear, Michael Caine (whose presence only reminded me of the Superior Original) as the Shadowy Cliff Brumby, John C McGinley as Hometown Henchman Com McCarty, the Criminally Underrated Mickey Rourke as Cyrus Paice and the Stunning Rhona Mitra as Geraldine, Sly's Link to the Underground. They all give Restrained, Mature Performances that Perfectly Fit the Feel that the film is aiming for.\nThe Scenes where Stallone and Rourke face off are worth Purchase Price Alone, I simply Could Not Choose who I wanted to come out on Top. They are Two of my Favourite Tough Guys. Gretchen Mol makes a Good Impression in a very small part. (an Extended Cameo that has Good Performances from her and Sly, but it Worked Better in the Original) Her scenes, as well as Rachel Leigh Cook's scenes, nearly all feature Sly, and they are the films Best Scenes, Acting wise.\nAction wise, the film is subdued. There are two well-staged Car chases that have been a little Over Edited, they still Achieve their Goal. Sly dishes out some Harsh Beatings, but the film never becomes a Full On Action film like Most of Sly's Resume. Fans of \"Copland\" should enjoy this, the two films share a lot in common, eg. Mood, Tone and Performances. In the End, the film is more of a Triumphant Return for Mickey Rourke than it is for Stallone... In my opinion, Stallone never left.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211325", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Although this book would not be placed in the \"suspense\" category, I am not joking when I say that I found myself infused with tension, gripping the pages and barely able to refrain from rushing through the pages to see how things would resolve. Anyone who is a parent will see exactly what I mean as the plot unfolds! The author has woven together several different subplots into a unified whole, all set in a unique time in history I have never read about before. I was fascinated to observe people's reactions to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I kept imagining how I would feel contemplating the potential of nuclear strikes near my home. But I was most absorbed into the fate of Scott and Gina's marriage and the welfare of their sons. I found myself reflecting on the health of my own marriage and whether I am treating my wife as she deserves to be treated. Am I investing in my children the way I need to? Am I being the man God has called me to be? The author has succeeded at creating a story that left my heart racing, while leaving me pondering the deeper questions of life at the same time. Now THAT takes skill!\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish, from the dramatic, moving plot, to the wonderfully drawn characters, to the satisfying ending. Well done, Dan Walsh! 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nBook has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc.

The unit does not seem to be much but it does do a lot.  Usb 3.0 is way faster than the traditional Usb.  I am able to move data without having to worry about the wait.  I am not talking about small couple hundred Mbs files but I am talking about gigs of data.  The unit itself is built strong.  I have not tried throwing it against the wall and I don't plan too either.  But from what I can tell it is pretty good.  The nice thing is that I has a small footprint so it does not take up much space on my table.  And not that I am a stickler about this but another positive not is it matches the paint job on the mac.  The only complaint I have the usb cable it comes with is pretty short.  I was hoping to put it at the corner of my desk but it is what it is for now.  Will probably look for a longer cable down the line.  Overall the usb hub/ card reader is amazing.  I would highly recommend this unit to anyone that is in need of extra usb ports.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a reduced price so that I would give my unbiased honest opinion, which I did.

I have spent enough time with them to feel comfortable sharing my opinion, but my experiences may differ from yours. Its always best to demo a headphone before purchasing, but if you're unable to I recommend at least reading other views in conjunction with this review.\n\nThanks to RHA for the review sample.\n\nBuild & Fit\nBuild\nThe RHA are wonderfully crafted in-ear monitors from top to bottom, coloring me impressed from the moment that they left the beautiful packaging. The housings are made of stainless steel with a barely visible line that joins the two halves. The nozzle is removable and unscrews easily by hand and is reattached smoothly in the same fashion. Each cable leaving the housing is clearly designated either blue or red for left or right, respectively, at the base of the memory wire. The cable itself is a tad bulky, but inspires confidence in the durability of it. Stress relief is adequate at the end of the durable looking straight plug, relieved by a metal spring rather than a rubber sheath. All of this is backed by a 3 year warranty, not too shabby.\n\nFit\nI find the T20 to be very easy to arrange around the ear as well as with inserting the nozzle into a secure position. The IEM sits at a moderate depth, but manages to block out a good amount of noise passively, more than enough to use in crowded college hallways. Comfort-wise these are a notch above every deep insertion IEM that Ive used, as well as much less picky about positioning to obtain optimal sound. I have these inserted and positioned in my ears in a few seconds per ear, with comfort and stability that allows me to wear these with no issues for the 2 hours at a time that I tend to wear them. The large variety of tips should ensure a secure and comfortable fit for most users.\n\nSound Quality\nOverall\nRegardless of which filter was used sibilance is apparent, the midrange is recessed, and the bass is overly prominent. Sibilance varies with filter tips and despite the bass being prominent the low-end leans tight and controlled. The filters only affect the upper-midrange and treble, thus leaving the bass to have a heavy presence without EQ. The driver is relatively free of distortion and the bass carries quite a thump with an overall sound signature being decidedly V-shaped with the exception of the bass filter. Overall soundstage presentation lacks width and depth, but has good left/right panning and positional accuracy.\n\nReference Filters\nI was excited to see the word reference as I have been looking for a neutral IEM to accompany my HD600. Unfortunately reference filters don't equate to a reference sound. Outside of the common characteristics of the overall sound, the reference tips offer the largest amount of sibilance and a moderate upper-midrange boost that gives the reference filters a moderate v-shaped sound signature. The sibilance was so much that I found Glory Box from Portishead and I Cant Feel My Face from The Weeknd to be completely unlistenable.\n\nI don't think that RHA intended reference to mean reference quality sound, rather reference in regards to the variety of filters.\n\nTreble Filter\nI had reservations after listening to the reference filters. I was scared that these would be even more sibilant. Somehow thats not the case, despite the treble being raised. This filter adds further presence in the upper ranges, further increasing the v-shape to a rather heavy v-shape. Sibilance is still present though and theres a bit of grain added compared to the reference tips. Nothing else has changed, only the uppermids/treble are affected with the filter change so its not a shock.\n\nBass Filter\nThe bass filter offers the most linear midrange to treble balance of all of the tips while providing a large amount of bass. There is a slight veil due to the prominence of the low-end, but the driver controlls the low-end rather well. Sibilance is reserved, there seems to be some brightness inherent in the drive but I don't find myself wincing on snare hits as I did with the reference tips. I find this filter to be the most enjoyable of the three, especially with hip-hop, due to the relaxed upper frequencies and powerful bass. Despite me enjoying this filter the most, its nowhere near an all purpose tuning. This tuning reminds me a bit of the HyperX Cloud and DT770 Pro 80ohm.\nConclusion\nOverall the T20 is a v-shaped IEM that DT770 owners would want to consider for portable use. They offer 3 filters that change the presence of the higher frequencies for those that want a tweak to the sound without using software EQ. Build quality, a massive amount of tips, and comfort are the strong points here, all backed by a 3 year warranty.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.87}, {"id": "211347", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The title is apt, because Pollack wrings every DROP of wisdom from each of the cards, presenting you with myriad possibilities and points of view.  Yet she never takes an authoritative, know-it-all tone.  This book is a presentation of relevant information and beliefs that you must choose to integrate into your understanding of the cards (or push aside for now).\n\nWhat this book does well is bring to light a fascinating array of connections and valid ideas about Tarot in general, and specifically suit by suit, card by card.  Rather than tell you what interpretation is \"right,\" 78 Degrees presents what most occultists have considered correct--in addition to the intuition they tapped for each individual reading.  Pollack recognizes that Tarot is a living, evolving occult practice which requires an intelligent system of meaning as well as an intuitive, experienced reader.\n\nBUY IT.  Definitely worth it.\n\nA few books you'll probably enjoy if you study Tarot:\n\n1) The Ultimate Guide to Tarot Card Meanings (by Brigit Esselmont) [***It's an e-book written by a Tarot expert in Australia.  Search for Biddy Tarot and you'll get to a site full of free info on Tarot, plus links to her books.  Pretty amazing.  One of my top three favorite books on interpretations so far.  Down to earth, in-depth, and accurate.]\n\n2) The Complete Book of Tarot Reversals (by Mary K.

And a misunderstanding involving an adornment which was taken by one to be a symbol of one hated in times past.\n\nOk, the escape to London is well done - tense in fact, but then the first problem crops up: the foresty / wildernessy sections are too much and too repetitive. But the retrieval of the locket and the escaping from Gringots are brilliant. Percy's return is too late and not covered enough to boot, and then the death toll is something Arnie, Bruce and Sly would baulk at. In the end, a very unsatisfactory ending, for me and on this occasion I can't just toe the line re niceties, as in 'I think' or 'In my opinion'; the truth is, most HP fans I know were not happy at this ending, and even if this was in the end grudgingly taken on board, then that does not alter the fact that the epilogue is woeful.\n\nSeeing as the magnificent efforts preceding this, the final book, were in the main, superb, I just think this is a sad and unsatisfactory ending to the Harry Potter series.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211357", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

There are so many positives to be found in this book that I don't think I can list them all.  On the other hand I didn't find anything at all that I would consider a negative.\nGeneral Alexander wrote this book for his family at his daughter's request.  She wanted to be sure that they had a clear record of the General's role in the war.  Since Alexander never intended for this to be published, it is not written in the deep, dry, and dull formal Victorian style.  Instead it is written almost as a long letter to his family and is therefore easy to read and understand.  I spent several long nights, well past my bedtime, engrossed in the General's story.  That seldom happens with a dull book.\nAlexander's having written this for his family is also a plus in that he is entirely honest.  He has no ax to grind, no score to settle, and no point to make.  Many civil war leaders, both military and civilian wrote memoirs after the war.  Unfortunately, most were written with the idea of aggrandizing themselves or proving they weren't at fault for a particular failure.  Longstreet for example, wrote an excellent book but he spends all too much time trying to defend himself from the vicious attacks that were being launched on him.  There is none of that here.  Alexander calls things as he sees them.  For example he heaps praise on General Lee for the most part, but where he finds fault, he says so.  There is also a great deal of praise for General Grant to be found in these pages.\nFinally, in various capacities Alexander was in close contact with the Confederate high command throughout the war.  From First Bull Run to Appomattox Alexander was there.  He was with the Virginia Army in all of its major efforts and was with Longstreet on his trip to Tennessee.  Seldom can one find this kind of insight into both of the Confederacy's major armies.  There are amusing tales, stories of the hardships faced by the common solider, and touching reflections on Alexander's last meeting with some of his comrades who were killed in battle.\nDo not pass this opportunity up.  This book is an enjoyable read and is full of insight.  If any book belongs in a well-stocked civil war library, this one does.  Alexander probably did as much service to his native south with this book as he did during four years of war.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211364", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Also, if you want to learn enough Italian to get you through a trip to the country, this would also do the job for you.\n\nHowever, this in no way is a true course in the language, which means studying Italian in the cultural context, developing the ability to read stories and novels, newspapers and magazine, and discuss daily life with adequate skills - the Oxford set will not bring you to that point.  So, evaluate your needs, and choose accordingly.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "211373", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Jill Myles is a favorite author of mine.  She knows how to bring the humor and sexiness to her romance novels and this book was no exception.  After reading this, I will never look at camping the same way.\n\nMiranda Hill is the town librarian who is notorious for her Internet rendezvous with former boyfriend and ex-NHL star, Dane Croft.  She has spent the last nine years with an awful reputation and nickname because of compromising pictures of her make-out session in a closet with Dane.  Dane Croft returns home to Bluebonnet to start a new life and new business.  Miranda decides she wants revenge and joins Dane's survival camp.  She soon changes her tune when things heat up between them during their week in the woods and her heart just might be in the way of her getting even.\n\nThe chemistry between Dane and Miranda and the sex scenes were blazing hot.  I highly recommend this sultry read for all lovers of comtemporary romance.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211374", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

You better know the goals and the tactics, lest you be drawn in by the pretty government speak of the usual agencies involved.\nThis is a \"know your enemy\" book, know who and how your property rights are slowly being taken away. Quite frankly, if I had not read the document UN Agenda 21, and read the UN quotes about \"private property\" being \"unsustainable\", some of their pretty excuses sound good.

However, it needs to be shown to local administrators, AFTER they have a grasp that UN Agenda 21 is the death knell for private property rights.

The rechargeable battery life is OUTSTANDING. I could not get this thing to die. It lasted well over 15 hours of being turned on, suggesting that you will rarely have to charge this device.\n\nThe solar panel is kind of a gimmick. Does it work? Yes. However, don't expect to leave this device out in the sun for 20 minutes and be given a fully charged device. This device will take at least 24 hours of direct sunlight to function on solar power. This is more of a last resort or emergency feature. Think end of the world or out backpacking in the woods without electricity situations.\n\nThe lantern comes with a hook attached to it so you can easily hang the lantern up if necessary which is a good feature.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful lantern. The battery life is outstanding, and I really enjoy that you can power the device three ways; battery, rechargeable DC battery, and solar power. While the solar power is a cool feature, the panel is small, so it takes a very long time to charge. Use this feature only as a last resort.\n\nI received this product to test in exchange for an honest review.

It is not a pleasant memory. I tried this on with undergarments (top and bottom), and is how I'll wear it - for maximum comfort and effectiveness/cleanliness (I'm the 'weirdo' who wears underwear with pantyhose too, fwiw).\n\nI normally wear a 12/XL, but followed advice and bought a L - it fight perfect. It was tight, but not soul sucking, OMG I CANT BREATHE tight, just a reassuring \"you're sucked and tucked and look fabulous\" squeeze, like the hug of a trusted friend. To test the effectiveness, I put on a dress I love that shows the dreaded \"belly button shadow\" - and it smoothed out all the lines and made a much nicer shape. I asked my boyfriend his thoughts, and had him compare the dress with and without the shapewear - he said it was subtle difference, but he did notice one. I'm not crazy, I don't think this will shave 50 or even 25 lbs off my body, but I appreciate the smoothing effective it (and any shapewear) gives, and my boyfriend did think the dress looked better with this.\n\nI wasn't sure how comfortable this would be over my own bra - it was, and I decided to buy several other styles. It's a great purchase, because even if it's a small difference, there are some dresses (right or wrong) that I feel self conscious in that this will let me without stupid insecurities at the forefront of my mind. No one (myself included) NEEDS shapewear, but I think it can help you feel confident in your body and in your skin, eventually feeling that way without it. I know there are more expensive versions out there, but for me, this did the trick great.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211393", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

With no idea where to find him, Royce and Hadrian disguise themselves as sailors in order to board the Emerald Storm, which is the ship believed to be delivering a message to Merrick.\n\nMr. Sullivan has stepped up the action even more for his 4th book about Royce and Hadrian, the professional thieves known as the Riyria. As they sail the Emerald Storm, unknown enemies conspire against them. Raiders hound the ship's wake and their destination is the jungle islands just past the edge of civilized world, where warrior tribes and outlaw bands plot to ally themselves with the Imperialists. And, their goal now just within their grasp, Thrace, Princesses Arista and Amilia intensify their scheme to free the rebel leader Degan Gaunt.\n\nSo far, The Emerald Storm is my favorite book of the series. There are a few elements reminiscent of classic adventure literature, a who-done-it mystery, a pirate tale, and a thriller-type plot twist or two. I particularly enjoyed the warrior-tribe culture of the land of Calis.\n\nAs with all these books, parts might be just a little over-the-top, and there are few things, like the system of magic, that veteran fantasy-readers may find too simplistic, but that's the kind of story this series is. Mr. Sullivan is focusing on just having fun. The theme is in tune with the likes of The Three Musketeers or Pirates of the Caribbean. It's a series that could be considered more or less kid-friendly, but definitely not categorized as YA. When thought of in those terms, RIYRIA REVELATIONS is on its own out there in the fantasy genre, or, at least, the only story like it that stands out.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "211395", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Even after all the beatings and living life without a mother and a father, she still counted and appreciated her one single blessing of having an uncle who loved her.  She doesn't dwell on the past, doesn't hold onto hate... and what's even more amazing is her unselfish side of wanting to help others find peace and happiness.  Duncan is a true warrior in every way.  He's honorable & patient. Practical & very disciplined...until love sinked in, and that's when practicality & disciplined became somewhat a burden.\nThe slow realization and acceptance of love between the two was simply perfect.  Each scenes, little gestures of passions made this book irrisistible.  There are many heart warming and humorous scenes in this book as well... The warming of Duncan's feet, the wedding, the learning of archery, the finding of the WOLF, the beginning of friendship with Duncan's sister, Adela & a whole lot more.  I could go on and on but I don't want to give it all away here for those who haven't read it yet. Oh, I must add that I find Madelyne's clumsiness entertaining. The secondary characters all contributed to make this book worth reading for as well.  Perhaps J.G. will write a sequel or a seperate book for Duncan's brothers and Adela's love story?  The family twist and complications added spice and thrill from front to end.  A must read & a keeper!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211409", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Every piece comes out for cleaning in the dishwasher within a minute or less, so the over always stays clean as new with no effort. The oven fold down so compactly when not in use, that it fits in a pantry shelf, ready to got in a moments notice. Nothing, and I mean nothing cooks chicken like this oven. Without extra injections of marinades, chicken comes out moist and falling off the bone within 45 minutes or less, even for a large bird. In the oven, it would lake at least and hour, and even then with some pink spots. This is foolproof. I'm really excited to work a turkey next. Once a wekk we rotiss a whole chicken and get a meal out of that, and then save the rest to make broth for soup later in the week. Nothing is healthier than this as the meat never sits in grease which you then consume. It fall to the bottom tray after self basting and washes up without even needing to touch it in the dishwasher.

The pearls are very pretty and delicate, and the twisting of the different stands adds a unique visual texture to the piece.\nThe large pearl in the silver setting sits nicely at the hollow of my neck, and moves freely, so I never end up with a necklace that looks off-center haha.\nOverall, this is an incredibly pretty necklace. The sparkling crystals and high-shine silver accent the beautiful pearls in a way I didn't expect. The combination of both materials makes this necklace look classic AND contemporary! I absolutely love it so far, and would highly recommend it to others. I think that this style would suit both young and more mature alike, and look good on any age! Definitely a big hit with me, and I can be a little hard-to-please with jewelry haha.

As far as unsnapping goes, unless the other reviewers were grabbing the very end of the flap and yanking it carelessly, I can't see how the snap would ever tear away from the flap. If you are firmly grabbing the flap at the snap, it comes right off with little effort. Either way, yes it is getting easier (if that were possible) with use.\n\nAnother thing to note in regard to the snug fit.... There is a small ridge or flap of fabric at the inner base of the holster that grabs the flashlight at it's base and does make it a bit difficult to pull out of the holster at times.  It also can interfere with inserting the flashlight completely into the holster. I've found that with use, that issue goes away as the holster loosens up.\n\nAll around great holster for this type of flashlight.

They kind of pop in quick, so you don't need to know their backgrounds. This is told in dual POV so you get to experience both Cody and Reese inner thoughts and struggles.\n\nI have to say, I loved Reese. She was spicy, down to earth and funny as hell. I think we would make great friends. She's a fighter and a realist, but she was willing to open her mind to explore the whole Haunted Hotel rumour. She gave this book that extra something special.\n\nCody... oh boy, where can I can one? He was a little bit alpha, but not overbaring, he knew he couldn't go in guns-a-blazing with Reese.

However, it did not take long for me to become completely spoiled with the ease of use and speed of this opener. The opener will come with 4 rechargeable batteries (at least mine did even though the description says they are not included), which fit into the top of the unit. Just take the end cap off and look closely at the area where the batteries go and you will see the + and - signs for how to place the batteries before replacing the end cap. While I could use my opener right out of the box, it is recommended that you first charge the unit with the charging cord, that also comes with the wine opener. Simply plug the male end into the opener and plug into the wall. The red indicator light will let you know that the batteries are charging. To use this could not be more simple. There are two soft rubber buttons, one turn the corkscrew clockwise, the other counterclockwise. The advantage here is that once you place the opener over the bottle, hold down the button and remove the cork, you can then reverse the direction to discharge the cork into your hand. There is no twisting, pulling or clever wrist action needed to use this. If you can press a button, you can open a bottle of wine, which will be wonderful for anyone with painful hands or hands with limited movement abilities. You will also receive a replacement screw in case you should ever need it. To date, we've had no broken corks and the unit has never jammed. I also like that the screw is always completely enclosed in the plexiglass surrounding it so that nothing can get tangled in it during use. It also helps protect the sharp tip. My guess is that after you try this wine opener, the rest of the ones you own will all sit in a drawer.

Joyride is a seriously fun, action packed space adventure. Earth made contact with alien races and is now ruled by a dictatorship that restricts anyone from leaving the planet. With this premise, the book could have gone really dark and turned into a dystopian story. Instead, everything about it is bright and energetic. There are conflicts to keep things interesting though.\n\nI love the characters. From the rebellious Uma to the hitchhiker Kolstak. Every one of them adds personality to the book. There is enough variety to keep me engaged and prevent things from becoming flat. The development of the characters individually and as a whole over the course of the story is great too. Despite some differences, it sort of makes sense that they would keep travelling together.\n\nBut the stand out portion of this book is the art. I really like the style for the characters. Most of them are little more than kids and the art captures that. Their expressions are detailed and support the text. The colors do a lot to create the tone of the book. I think the panel work is awesome too. They do a lot to draw the eye down the page, so even if they are used in an unusual way I didn't feel confused as to where I should be looking or reading next. Then there are the scenes that juxtapose two characters. These go a long way to show how the characters are similar and different without spelling things out.

An unsophisticated group of stone age hunter-gatherers who had eked out a living on the edges of better territory dominated by larger and more formidable Native American peoples than themselves, the Comanche eventually discovered the horse, left to run wild and multiply in North America after the Spanish had retreated south in the face of rebellions against them. The Comanche soon realized that horses were good for more than just eating or dragging tent poles behind them when the bands moved camp and became the most effective mounted warriors in North America and, Gwynne suggests, maybe in the world. A small, stocky people well suited for riding, they rapidly came to dominate the central and southern plains of North America, placing them directly in the path of the expanding American Republic as it moved westward via new settler migration and war with Mexico over the western territories held by that country.\n\nGwynne intersperses his tale of the rise of the Comanche and their fierce war with other Indian tribal nations (including Apaches and Tonkawas, both of whom would develop an undying hatred of their foes and align themselves with the incoming whites to eventually bring the Comanche down) with an account of the background, birth and rise of Quanah Parker, the half white war chief of the Comanche nation who would lead them in their final struggle with white civilization. In the interim, the Republic of Texas broke away from Mexico to become the Comanche's most dangerous enemy. But not at first.\n\nInitially, the early Texans were outclassed because they were used to the forests and mountains of their eastern homes. Armed only with the slow-to-reload muzzle loading rifles of the era (which required plenty of cover between shots and could not be easily reloaded on horseback), they could neither outshoot nor outride the wild Comanche warriors in a country where cover was scarce and often non-existent. It took a series of disastrous defeats before the Texans slowly got it together and learned to fight with the relentless ferocity of the Comanche from horseback, mastering the trails and redoubts of the country itself in the process. Nor did it hurt when the advent of the revolver in the mid 1840's gave the newly formed, and still green, Texas Rangers a marked advantage over the mounted Comanche warrior equipped only with bow and arrow.\n\nThe book recounts the gradual erosion of Comanche dominance as it gives the history of Quanah's mother, Cynthia Ann Parker, captured as a nine year old girl and adopted by members of the Comanche band that took her. Eventually married to a Comanche warrior, she is finally retrieved by whites only to pine away until her early death because of her lost husband and sons. Quanah, her eldest, is left to fend for himself at the age of twelve and eventually grows into a large and powerful warrior in his own right, the man who will lead the last free band of Comanches until he is finally run to ground and beaten by the U.S. Army -- having at last learned to fight Indians the Indian way.\n\nThis is a fine book that deals with an important part of Texas history as well as the history of America's western plains overall.

TECHNICALLY speaking, as they seem to have all the pieces down that would make up a great Viking metal band - Fantastic vocalist (honestly one of the very best I've ever heard), great production, full on bass, intense drumming, great guitar chops, great potential in their musical atmospheric techniques. The problem here, and what I've noticed in EVERY album from this band besides the latest, 'Northern Star,' is that the pieces simply aren't put together well or used to their fullest potential to make a memorable album. I honestly don't know what all these other reviewers are listening to, but if you're trying to convince me that this is one of the greatest metal albums ever created, I simply have to laugh at you, you most likely have no other metal albums in your entire collection.\n\nI won't break down each song one by one, but on the whole this album mostly bored the life out of me, although I was able to see what kind of atmosphere the band was going for, the songs in the end just weren't very GOOD. I think the reason most people tend to fall in love with this band so quickly is because of the vocals - the guy's gifted with a very soothing natural voice, and when he puts it in song it has a very VERY epic and \"viking\" feel; this only is emphasized in the sections when the band sings together in unison for certain parts. The second track on the album is sung in their native tongue (a dialect of Norwegian) and the vocals in the song are produced to stand out, and if they were just sung with no instruments it might work, but the thing with heavy metal music is that you NEED some good guitar work to stand behind the vocals. ....the guitar work here (riffs and licks) is so overly simplified and sounds as if they just made it up as they went along, and just wanting everyone to hear their vocals more than anything else, the guitars really just taking a back seat.\n\nThere are 2 songs on this album that I decided to keep on my Ipod, because while they aren't masterpieces, they do have some pretty good choruses (which honestly feels more like luck than anything else). Still, even within these 2 songs the choruses are too few and far between, and mostly surrounded by more substandard guitar work (in the realm of creativity at least); I wish they would've just listened to these songs more and trimmed the fat off of them.\n\nA masterpiece?? I don't think so, not even close. This is one of those albums that gets by on the band's image, cover art, lyrical themes, and bare bones vocal work (if this band had a different vocalist, I seriously think EVERYONE would hate this album)... but when it comes down to actual creative and engrossing songwriting, this album drags lazily and never makes any attempt to pick up the pace. If you're into bands like Ensiferum, Wintersun, Blind Guardian, or other melodic metal or viking metal bands, this album will do nothing for you. If you're curious to get into Tyr, I would strongly suggest only picking up their latest album - By The Light Of the Northern Star, which finally feels like the first album where the band finally decided to take more time into making good guitar-driven songs (it only took them 4 albums to finally get it somewhat right).\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "211480", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

In part one of the book, the author describes the nine steps toward achieving favorable change.  These stages include developing a sense of urgency, unifying the team, communicating a clear vision, etc.  Part two of the book focuses in the broad sense on how to lead this change which is mostly about effective communication and good planning.\n\nThere are some gems of wisdom in this text.  For instance, as part of step 8 (which is assessing, recruiting, and empowering the broader team), the author makes it clear why you might hire someone who failed on a project. The reason is that those who failed and learned from their mistakes may offer priceless insight.\n\nIn the communicating and connecting to inspire chapter he makes it clear that it is not about what you say; its about what they hear.  You may think your message inspires and motivates, but if your team has not heard it that way, you have not succeeded.\n\nTwo more quotes that I found inspiring were:\n\n1)  We earn the right to communicate electronically by the time and energy we invest in communicating personally.\n\n2) Electronic communication is a tool for communicating informationnot for inspiring passion.\n\nIn combination with the excellent advice, I would have liked examples with more substance, however.  For instance, he told how Howard Schultz (Starbucks CEO) inspired his staff everywhere by penning a weekly Transformational Agenda that he released on Mondays.  I would have liked a sample agenda in the book that dissected why and how this worked.  In another example, the author himself mentioned that he was questioned by an employee in a town hall meeting about how he and other executives received multi-million dollar bonuses and wanted to know how this equates with the culture of economy and expense control he was espousing.  The author mentioned how he publicly congratulated the employee for asking such a difficult question but never said how he answered it or why his answer worked and was inspiring.\n\nOverall, I feel this is a great book from which current and aspiring managers can gain some insight on how to lead change and inspire others.

It did include her and her fathers airport, but in the process of trying to convince Caroline (heroine) to use it, his heart has other plans. Once Tahoe has committed to something he isn't going to give up, (whether it is the girl or the airport). This is where the slow build to the story happens.\nHeartbreak tells you the love was real. You cant be afraid of the end at the beginning. Go full throttle and see what happens.\nTahoe has had his own heartbreak and has had a hard time moving on from it. Caroline never thought shed find love in her small town and never wanted to give herself to anyone until she starts dating Tahoe.\nYou get this feeling when you want to keep something. Its scary and vulnerable. It makes you feel like your skin is flipped inside out. It changes everything. Keeping that quality, keeping it, has to be protected at all costs. You become obsessed with keeping that which you cant sacrifice.\nThe both start falling hard and it scares them but as I said earlier, Tahoe is committed, but he is also obsessed with perfection.\nHer world is already open. Im excited to show her another piece of it.\nThis is a sweet story of two people that find each other at the right time.\nThis is a favorite quote of mine between the two characters; it is simple but so clever and really made me feel.\nIm falling for you, Caroline May.\nIm flying for you, Tahoe Holiday.\nIm going to lie and say Tahoe didn't piss me off, he definitely screws up and Caroline is a tough girl and held her ground with him, I loved that.\nOne thing I found that I really enjoyed about this book was its not the typical virgin romance and youll understand that once you read it.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211510", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

How important bonds are and the nurturing it takes to make successes of these bonds made this Christian Fiction book, more real that the word \"fiction\" implies.  Ma Grand and her daughter Pam had a strained relationship at best.  Ma Grand was from the `old school' so to say, where it wasn't as important to say those three magical words `I love you' as it was to show them.  She had inherited those traits from her parents so saw no need to give that type of attention to her daughter Pam.  When Marley came along, Pam felt differently about that towards her daughter and willingly lavished not only positive words, but also influence and affection upon her. It is this relationship that propels Marley to experience the same in her relationship with Gerrard her fianc.  As the novel begins, we are transported to the engagement party of this socialite couple and while things appear bright from the heavy hitters on the invitation list, looks can be deceiving.  As Marley soon finds out, her fianc has other interests that don't place his relationship with her in the forefront of his decisions and this leads to their eventual demise.  As Marley searches for strength in the midst of this pain, illness strikes home with her mother Pam.\nShrouded in seemingly dark clouds, an invitation to join her secretary in church provides a ray of sunshine to Marley.  As if God is speaking to her with every word that proceeds from the Minister's mouth, Marley has at last found solace - a resting place for her heart and soul.  An added bonus is the introduction of Lazarus into her life a God Fearing Christian, upright man.  Not many of them exist today and what a treasure when one is found.  It is through this relationship, with this Godly man that Marley reconciles in her mind the relationship between Ma Grand and her mother, and the relationship between her mother and herself.  God creates and nurtures bonds on an individual basis because of his omnipresence.  Marley blossoms into a strong Christian woman through the love of a great man and the love of great family.  Through That Faith, That Trust, That Love that Marley has for God, the manifestation is seen throughout her relationships others.  This is a very inspirational read to those of us who want our lives to be used by God for his purpose.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211512", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Carried by his Christian faith and an immense amount of determination, not only did Ryan Job survive being shot in the face and left blind, but he continued to lead a productive life despite facing huge challenges until a tragic error ended his life well before his time was up.\nIn this book, Robert Vera, a close friend of Ryan Job's, gives the reader an in-depth look at Ryan Job as a person, a soldier and most important a human being. He describes his sense of humor that lifts up others when they need help and a determination that makes Ryan seem invincible to those close to him and put seemingly nothing out of his reach. Most importantly, Robert Vera shows that Ryan Job after the injury in Iraq was able to recover and achieve a sense of normalcy that involves miletstones such as college graduation and hunting elk.\nThe book is broken up into three main parts, entitled Tested, Transformed and Redeemed that stand for the progression of Ryan Job from battle injured in Irag to finding a new life and normalcy back in the USA. Overall, while the book has strong Christian overtones in certain places, it does give the reader a good insight into the character of this extraordinary soldier and being written by a close friend gives the book an authenticity that makes the person of Ryan Job come alive.\nDisclaimer: I received a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

I recently picked it back up, having forgotten what it was about at all. So I went into it blind so to speak.\n\nI liked reading this book with no idea what it was about or what the concept was. I felt like I was reading a contemporary romance, but a good one. I was intrigued by the storyline, liked the characters, and was even surprised by an added element at the end.\n\nSummary - Jona has spent the last 12 years of her life in an orphanage because her mother dropped her off there. Jona is bitter, she has turned to the streets and gets caught quite frequently. After getting caught this last time her sentence is to live with her mother, aunt, and her uncle in France. While there her mother seeks for forgiveness and she makes a friend in Julian.\n\nLike I said I felt like 98% of this book is a contemporary romance, but when I reached the end I realized there was a paranormal aspect to it. Normally the paranormal is something I really have to be in the mood to read and it has to be really well done for me to enjoy it. With this book it makes up such a small part and it is done well that I didn't mind it at all.\n\nOne thing I am going to harp on is the amount of mistakes. I debated rating it 3 stars just for that reason, but the story was a good one so I nixed that idea. I just feel like mistakes take away from the ease of reading. I want to sit down and immerse myself in a book, not to be drawn from it by rough sentences.\n\nThe love story is really well done. I liked that it was a relationship that felt realistic and grew through the entire book. Jona and Julian really get to know each other and learn to trust in one another. I found myself wanting to turn the pages to find out how Jona and Julian were going to connect next or what problems they needed to work through.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211519", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

But before I get to that, I want to state for the record (no pun intended) how good this album is. If you loved 12 SONGS, you'll love this one, too. It's that simple. They are done in the same style and Diamond's catchy melodies really work with the expanded band used for this recording. It's pure Diamond. Any Neil Diamond fan knows what I'm talking about. I purchased the version with the bonus tracks and the DVD. As for the bonus tracks the Dylan cover is great the other cover not so much. I don't know if this is due to the fact that both of he bonus tracks are not Diamond compositions so they don't quite gel or what. The Dylan one is very good the other just seems a bit out of place. Perhaps further listenings will correct this.\n\nAs for the DVD, it should be great! You get a couple of live performances and a couple of studio performances. My knock against it is that, after the first tune, you can't hear ANY vocals. They are either mixed down to a whisper or were poorly recorded in the first place. On the last tune, The Boxer, they are just gone. You can't hear a word. I thought perhaps my DVD is defective in some way. Has anyone else encountered this problem.\n\nBut if you're a Diamond fan and have your eye on the single CD version of the album, then I can't recommend it highly enough. Just be wary of the DVD. It's an exercise in frustration. There's Neil singing his heart out and you can't hear a word!\n\nHowever the album is one of the best I've heard this year.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211521", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

This book has on every page jokes and vocabulary that would challenge my college students.  And yet the book is targeted to small children.  Let me throw you a few examples: The Senses Taker, Dynne (a play on \"din\" and \"djinn\"), Kakofonous A. Dischord Doctor of Dissonance.  Some needlessly tough words: salve, disdainfully, brandishing, gelatinous, and countless more.\n\nTo be fair, there are a great many things accessible to children, such as (literally) jumping to (the island of) Conclusions, the watchdog (a dog with a clock in his middle), and Alec, the floating boy who is growing down.  Moreover, the Jules Feiffer illustrations are superb.  They greatly help to make sense of the difficult concepts in this work.\n\nCharitably, one could say that the author intended a whole set of bon-mots for the adult reader, and a more innocent story for the young.  But I don't think this is the case.  I think that Juster terribly overshot his audience and created a book better for adults than children.  For those determined to read this book, reserve it for older children who are very strong readers.

I was debating whether to buy it because of the price, and the fact that my husband needed to install it and I wasn't sure how complex it would get (don't want him to break our sink/kitchen). Up to when I had purchased this filter, I had been doing fine buying filtered water at the grocery store and using a water stand since we only needed to refill three 5 gallon bottles maybe once every 2-3 weeks. But we went ahead and made the investment, and so far it has been a really great decision. Regarding the installation, the kitchen and sink area definitely did get messy. I'll go over some of the issues that my husband faced when installing the filter.\n\n1) You need to make sure you have the right drill bits to drill a hole through your sink. Whether porcelain or stainless steel, you need the right tools to get a hole through your sink without creating any extra damage. If you make an awkward sized hole, the water tap may not properly seal and water may drip under the sink.\n\n2) Make sure you are comfortable with tools, drilling holes into your sink drain, and drilling holes into the sides of the sink cabinet to install the filtration system. not so much for the sides but some people may not like the idea of drilling a hole into the sink drain which you have to.\n\n3) My husband had a VERY hard time because of the angle of the faucet and sink drain connecting the cold water metal connection that connects to the filter. Hopefully your sink is spacious, because if it's small or cramped with weird angles, some tubing and parts of the installation that require tightening nuts may be tricky.\n\n4) Lastly, you have to be confident that once you start the project you will finish it, and that you will do it correctly. There are so many tubes and connections throughout the filter installation that involve so many areas such as the water line, sink drain, and the filter itself, that there are many possible areas for leaks, disconnects, and other issues. You can't just install and leave it, for the first two days after install, there was a total of 2 leaks that occurred. Two were due to tubes not being properly pushed all the way in, and a one took some time to develop and was hard to spot at first. It needs to be installed right because realistically if you leave home for hours on end, or for a long vacation, the connections need to be right or else it just takes one tube to POP and there goes your savings.\n\nOther than these points, as other reviewers have said, the water filtration and taste is excellent. The water appears crystal clear, and health wise it is an excellent investment since I find myself drinking a lot more water and taking water from home since it is so easily accessible. I hope my review has been helpful, enjoy your filter if you buy one!\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211525", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Few books do that to me.  I read this book due to seeing it recommended on Goodreads and then reading the Amazon reviews and the Sample.\n\nI know we have all read or heard about people who have met with near death experiences and how, usually, the life goals, the values, the meaning of life are changed in a deep and lasting way.  Darcy has such an experience and it is one which gives him months to dream, to contemplate and to plan.  He also updates his will and writes letters to all who might need to know his wishes.\n\nThis book has many parallels to canon but there are several differences: one is that the Netherfield Ball is now a masquerade and another is the resulting duel as Wickham is found seducing one of the guests.  I don't want to post spoilers here but will add that this author does a good job with slight changes to or new happenings.  I really liked reading the thought processes from both Elizabeth's and Darcy's POV.  Elizabeth's powers of observations as to even the type of clothing worn by her mystery man and then discernment about subtle changes in behavior bringing realizations as to who is lying and manipulating circumstances were well written.  Darcy's eavesdropping does, as we all know it will, bring pain but also achieves what the Hunsford proposal did in canon.  Darcy does a good deal of soul searching and gains some insights.  He acts as a man of honor and justice and protection towards those he cares about.\n\nThe only chord which might read as out-of-tune was the affect of the final lie from Wickhams mouth.  It might be interpreted as Wickham putting in one last effort to wound Darcys soul as he did his body but then, although Darcy had moments of misgivings about Elizabeth which were disappointing, they were just that, MOMENTS, immediately after which he did suggest an anvil visit to Elizabeth.\n\nI would have liked more at the endespecially of the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth, even the reaction of friends and family.  And I do love epilogues.that heir to Pemberley, etc.  But overall this is a book which I will say I do recommend to all.

But as a die hard Richelle Mead fan, I couldn't resist requesting this when it popped up on Edelweiss. Perhaps it is because I'm such a die hard fan that I couldn't help but be disappointed by this book.\n\nBesides being a huge Mead fan, I picked up this book because the premise seemed freaking fantastic. In this, at least, I wasn't disappointed. Mead has created a huge world with a diverse population-did I mention huge? This book travels like nobody's business. The very idea that the Republic of United North America is cracking down on religions, or as they say \"belief in fictitious entities,\" is really cool-especially because it's obvious right from the get go that there are some larger forces at work. The involvement of the various gods-and especially Justin's ravens-kept me engaged in this book even when everything else wanted to through me out.\n\nThis book is told from multiple points of view, mostly Justin and Mae's. The story is told in the third person, yes, but there still never felt like there was much of a difference between their narrations. The characters themselves came off as a little flat, which was strange because so much time was spent investigating what made them tick. Mead was very thorough in giving background on her characters, and all of them had multiple facets that I enjoyed. But there was still something that kept them from lifting off the page for me, a kind of stiffness that I can't explain. It was quite strange.\n\nThe plot and pacing of the book also seemed to drag on a little. Mead, as usual, is all about plots and subplots, but I wasn't as invested in some of them as I could be. Perhaps it is because some where mentioned in the book but then not really addressed. The character of Tessa bothered me especially, because I didn't understand the point of watching this girl from the provinces adjust to life at high school while Justin and Mae were out playing with gods and murderers. Most times she just seemed like a human plot device, whose actions only facilitated certain events that needed to happen.\n\nOverall, however, I think this was a successful book. I might have gotten bored in places, but I always kept reading. The intrigue with the multiple deities running around kept me hooked, and will keep me hooked for the next book. I would recommend this book for people captivated by the world Mead is creating. It's not one I'd urge you to buy in hardcover (especially because it's an adult book and gollywhiz those prices for hardcovers), but if you see it in paperback or at the library and think it might be interesting, I'd be all over that.\n\n(And if you missed this at the beginning of the review, this is NOT a ya book. It is an adult book and there are sexy times. If that's not your thing, you've been warned.)\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211544", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Then again, this book purports to be about a possible murder and it is in more ways than one.  Now that I'm thinking about this review, I am finding it difficult to talk about the book without giving something away and I definitely don't want to do that.  This book is so well written and so clever and so well thought out by the author and one of the characters that I found it mesmerizing.  This is some great storytelling!  This would make a great movie if it were well done.\n\nI found myself thinking about marriage and what makes them work--or not.  My daughter recently told me how much she loves her husband and how she works to make their marriage work.  She is willing to overlook things, to forgive, to look for the good things and to be willing to work hard to find the good and the happy things and she recommits to that idea every single day.  She strives to be happy.  She makes it a commitment for herself, her husband and her family.  In this book, the couple became complacent as so many of us do and things become untenable for both parties but they dealt with it in very different ways.\n\nThis book also presents the reader with a character whose single minded determination and sheer will to make the marriage what she thought she had been promised with the end justifying the means.  She becomes the worst version of herself in all her psychotic \"madness\".  Her husband took a different and much more conventional approach.  In the end, I suspect they both won and they both lost.  You'll have to be the judge.\n\nThe ending quite surprised me.  I'll have to leave it at that but the characters explain their decisions and in the context of their characters, it made a certain kind of sense.\n\nI've heard that the author's other two books were no where near as good as this one.  I'll just have to wait for the next one and hopefully there WILL BE a next one!

Let me start off by saying I love the band's major-label debut, \"Fallen\", but this is really for the die-hard Evanescence fans. I did enjoy this package very much, but there were a few things that disappointed me. Here's the rundown...\n\nCD: The band sounded excellent when I saw them in concert during the U.S. leg of this tour. Although they perform well, I don't think they sound as good live as they do on the album, unless you're actually at the concert. Don't get me wrong, the band is VERY talented and Amy Lee is an amazing vocalist, but there are several times during the show when she is struggling to hit notes. I don't think she used \"studio-magic\" when making \"Fallen\" because during the back-stage segement of the DVD, she is singing beautifully. I just think that when she runs around on stage and gets out of breath, it gets hard for her to sing as well. As for the band, they sound fine, with the exception of the guitarist still trying to keep up with the solo's Ben Moody wrote before leaving the group. Ben was an amazing guitar player...the other guys are good to but during \"Going Under\" the solo is a little loose and is only about a quarter of the length as it is on the album. Aside from those things, the disc is really good. The guitars and drums sound very heavy, especially on the opening song \"Haunted\". For this show, the band performed 10 out of the 11 songs from their \"Fallen\" album, as well as 2 b-sides (\"Farther Away\" and \"Breathe No More\") and even a beautiful cover of Korn's \"Thoughtless\". I think these songs alone are worth buying this package for. Finally, the CD ends with a previously unreleased studio track called \"Missing\". It's a very nice song but I wouldn't say it's one of their best ever. Pretty good overall.\n\nDVD: This is the same performance as the one on the CD. Rather than just filming the concert with multiple cameras, lots of effects (such as slow-motion, repeating frames, blurred images) were added to make the performance more dramatic. This could be good or bad, depending on your outlook. I think it's good because it makes the performance more interesting to watch...but it could also be bad because it feels like your watching more of a music video rather than a concert. The backstage footage is pretty interesting, there's no interviews, it's just the band goofing off left and right, but it's pretty funny. You'll see brief cameos from the guys in Seether, Breaking Benjamin and Three Days Grace. Also included on this disc are the band's 4 music videos: \"Bring Me To Life\" / \"Going Under\" / \"My Immortal\" / \"Everybody's Fool\". The videos are good and it's nice to be able to watch them whenever I want.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211548", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

(Think Renee Russo meets Marilyn Monroe.) Give her a messy divorce from an apathetic husband, and threaten to take away her job--the only way for her to provide for her sickly young son. When her confidence is sufficiently shaken, put her in airport full of men she'll never see again and watch this normally self-assured and self-possessed woman test herself to see if she's still got \"IT\" by using one of the oldest tricks in the book: a very hot variation on the old bump-into-a-gorgeous-guy-and-dump-your-purse-at-his-feet stunt.\nNow take one haplessly unaware handsome man and put him in Kate's cross-hairs. Special effects wizard Mike Cameron (a Kevin Costner/Judge Reinhold amalgam) is simply minding his own business while waiting for his flight, reflecting upon the state of his long-term bachelorhood and finding it somewhat lacking. For the first time in his life he's giving serious thought to settling down. But how does he go about finding the right woman for himself? It's not as though she'll just fall into his lap, right?\nWhat worked for me:\nThis was a fun couple; I really liked the interaction between Kate and Mike. Kate had no qualms about possessing such a classically feminine shape, and seemed very comfortable with herself. Mike certainly loved the way she looked... Watching Mike pursue Kate was very enjoyable. I know I certainly wouldn't mind having a man like that chase after me!\nThere was also a very sweet secondary romance which I think might be interesting to explore as a prequel to this book, as well as potential for turning Kate into Cupid a few more times for Mike's three sisters.\nWhat didn't work for me:\nKate was understandably skittish about getting into a relationship again, especially since doing so put her young son's heart at risk as much as it did hers. But it still took her an _awfully_ long time to give in to her feelings.\n\nOverall:\nI really loved this book! It was fresh and funny with a unique approach. The little \"Dear Cupid\" letters at the opening of each chapter were wonderful, and the one at the end of the book was the best of all. :^) A great bubble bath book, but be forewarned that you'll spend a lot of time laughing so beware the danger of drowning yourself during a giggle fit.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211557", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I disagree. I've been a women's self defense instructor for over two decades, and crime statistics have consistently shown that one-in-three to one-in-four women will be the victim of a sexual assault in her lifetime. Those are pretty steep odds if you ask me, and based on the stories I've heard from my students, those stats are pretty solid.\n\nCertainly, violent crime rates have been going down since the 90's, but to say you don't need to learn this material is like saying you don't need to wear a seat belt, because the chance of being in a motor vehicle accident is trivial. Personally, I'd rather wear the seat belt and never need it, than need it someday and not be wearing it. And the same goes for learning the physical, mental, and emotional skills of self-defense.\n\nIn my opinion, mental preparedness is more important than physical preparedness in self-defense. And, if I had to recommend just one book for my wife or sister or daughter to read on self-defense, this book would be at the top of my list because it is both realistic and comprehensive in covering the necessary subject matter.\n\nPotential readers should note that this book does not teach actual techniques of self-defense. Thinking you can learn such things from a book is naive - go take a self-defense class if you want to learn physical skills. But what this book does teach, and teach very well, is the other side of self-defense training - psychological and emotional preparedness for a violent confrontation.\n\nIn almost three decades of martial arts and self-defense training and practice, I can count on the fingers of one hand how many martial arts instructors I have met who have addressed the issue of psychological preparedness and tactical awareness in everyday self-defense. Police, military, and executive security personnel are well aware of how important they are, but sadly even the best physical training programs in the civilian sector rarely touch on these topics.\n\nThankfully, now you can read Neal's book and learn what the smartest self-defense instructors teach about mindset, awareness, threat levels and risk assessment as it pertains to personal safety and survival in a violent world. And, he knows his stuff. Not only is the author an instructor under Geoff Thompson, he also has extensive experience working as a night club doorman as well (in the U.S. we call them bouncers). And in this case, good training + lots of real world experience = a very good self defense book.\n\nSo, if you want to learn what you need to know to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally (as much as one can) for surviving a violent encounter, read this book. It's well worth the price, and what you read here could very well save your life someday.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211570", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Only output the score and nothing else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Review:\nHave TV shows left behind episodic TV to take on the trappings of the novel? TV is now full of shows that have a vision of the series as a whole with a beginning, middle and end fully plotted before they even hit the screen. Shows like Lost, Hero's, Mad Men, and The Sarah Connor Chronicles have changed how we look at TV shows, and maybe the way we should think about them as well.\n\nI have to admit that when the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles went on I was excited, being as I'm a fan of The Terminator movies but as I watched the first couple of episodes I lost interest. Then I applied for a job as book reviewer for an ezine and they also wanted the book reviewer to review a science fiction TV series as well, so I picked The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I didn't get the gig reviewing books for that particular ezine but I watched the entire first season in one or two sittings and was able to view it as  a whole and saw the emerging themes and directions the creators of the show were trying to take, and I got excited about the possibilities they were exploring.\n\nThe Sarah Connor Chronicles picks up after the second Terminator movie. Sarah and John have settled down a bit, Sarah in love and living with a paramedic in Colorado, but they're still doing their best to stay off the grid and not attract attention to themselves. A Terminator shows up at John's school one day as a substitute teacher with a gun implanted in his thigh. When he opens fire and chaos ensues John is saved by Cameron, the cute new girl sitting next to him in class, who seems to be able to take a bullet pretty well. John escapes to the parking lot with the teacher terminator hot on his trail and just as John is cornered Cameron comes out of nowhere with a truck and runs down the terminator, and reveals herself to be a terminator sent by the future John Connor to save his teenage self. John and Cameron find Sarah but the police and the not quite terminated terminator are in hot pursuit of the three of them. Cameron leads them to a bank vault a seeming dead end, but the future John Connor has been planning ahead (or is it behind?) and he's been sending emissaries back in time to set up an infrastructure to protect himself in the past. Cameron rips open safety deposit boxes and starts assembling a device, a time machine, Cameron is going to hide John and Sarah in the future!\n\nAfter the escape to the future John convinces Sarah and Cameron that they can do more than wait for judgment day that they can again go after Skynet and destroy it before it can be built. They also discover that the terminator after John at the school got caught in the time vortex they went through so he's still after them, although he's a bit beat up and needs to reconstitute himself. Another antagonist FBI agent James Ellison is introduced, a police detective who believes Sarah Connor killed some police officers, and this addition has kind of The Fugitive feel to it and never really develops anything passed that.\n\nSarah soon discovers a computer prototype called The Turk that could become Skynet and built by a computer geek Andy Good, but she is able to torch it and unfortunately Andy's dreams. But John Connor isn't the only one salting away things in the past to change the future, Skynet is also stashing things such as a type of steel to build terminators. Sarah discovers that Andy has rebuilt The Turk and she runs off to destroy it (again) but finds she's too late that The Turk has been stolen and Andy Good has been killed by Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle who came back in the first Terminator movie to save her. Derek joins Sarah and John but is distrustful of Cameron and her motives because she is terminator but also because he knew her in the future and isn't convinced she doesn't have a hidden agenda, and some of her actions might indicate she has something to hide, Derek and Sarah discover that Cameron has kept a chip from a terminator but is she keeping it for Skynet's agenda? Or does she have a secret mission from the future John Connor?\n\nIn one of the more interesting episodes Bruce Davison plays another of his characters bordering on insanity. He's the psychiatrist at the mental institution Sarah escaped from in the second movie and he's stolen a hand from a terminator and Sarah is in a race to retrieve it before FBI agent Ellison does. In the penultimate episode of the season the doubts about Cameron finally come to the surface when it is discovered she saved the chip she was supposed to destroy. Cameron's motivations and actions increasingly are under scrutiny by Sarah. In the final episode Sarah and gang are offered the chance to buy the Turk for half a million dollars, and Sarah's love interest returns, and in the cliffhanging last scene Cameron is blown up by a truck bomb.\n\nI hadn't heard of most of the cast before The Sarah Connor Chronicles but in researching this review I found that most of them have pretty solid television credibility having appeared on Hero's, Firefly, and The 300, all pretty solid shows with reputations for smart episodes, so it seems the cast was picked well. The acting is uniformly good it doesn't delve into kitsch or melodramatics and the possibility always exists for those roads to be taken. Brian Austin Green who started his career in the great Spelling schmaltz factory of 90210 had me worried when he came into the show in the third or fourth episode as Derek Reese but he has consistently shown that he has the capabilities of good acting and has even carried the dramatics in a couple of the episodes.\n\nAllusion and metaphor aren`t found in a lot of TV shows, in a smartly written show you can find one or the other but not usually both. In the Sarah Conner Chronicles chess is used as a metaphor, and yes, I know chess is an overused metaphor in a lot of things but they didn't belabor the point and it worked in the context of the episode. The themes that are explored in The Sarah Conner Chronicles are more ambitious than in the Terminator movies. The show explores do the terminators cause people to act more machine like? Can machines learn to love man enough to need them? Can man love (come to terms with) his need for machines?\n\nEach of the three DVD's have bonus features that are quite a fun enhancement to the set. I enjoyed the actor audition video's especially Lena Headey's. She's an English actress and she effects an American accent quite well and believably but as soon as she drops out of character her English accent is noticeable and almost undecipherable!\n\nI think anyone who liked The Terminator movies and wants to explore that world a little deeper will certainly enjoy this series, as well as someone not all that knowledgeable about The Terminator world.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.94}, {"id": "211572", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

And again, it is a terrific tribute to two years of the man's work, this time chronicling the years 1957 and 1958.  Of the four books published to date, this book had many more strips which I was familiar with than the other three.  But there were still quite a few strips that I have never seen before, making it another fun reading experience.  The strip quality is better in general in this volume as it appears the publishers had access to quality masters to provide reproductions than they had in previous versions (I only noticed one strip that looked a little blurred in this book).  Obviously if you have the other three books, you'll be getting this one and you can expect more of the same great quality.\n\nIt was also nice to see that the publishers have kept their word where they said that if they found better or more complete strips that they would republish them in future books.  In this book, they republish a strip from the second volume where they didn't have a complete strip (they actually had to have an artist draw the missing panels).  But somebody out there had the complete strip and it has been republished here and is fully documented.\n\nMy only complaint about the books is that 2 books a year just isn't fast enough!

The graphics are flawless, however, the controls take some getting used to. Also, some of the zombie sounds are recycled from Resident Evil games of the 90's.

The first scenario, Outbreak, takes place on the streets of Raccoon city, reminiscent of Resident Evil 2 and 3. The only problem with it is that there is seemingly an endless supply of zombies, who can open doors. The second scenario, Below Freezing Point, is a lot of fun, as it takes place in Umbrella's secret lab from Resident Evil 2 and 0. The third scenario, The Hive, takes place in a hospital, I think the same one from Resident Evil 3. The only problem with this scenario is that there's a monster that always follows you around, and it reminded me of the Leech Monster from Resident Evil 0. The fourth scenario, Hellfire, takes place in a burning hotel, and is very cool, since it features the return of the Lickers. The fifth and final scenario is called Decisions, Decisions.

Each of their wonderfully unique personalities comes to life as Horner describes their foibles, their gifts and on how each helped her through critical junctures including a major life move from the Midwest to Texas, and the diagnosis of her daughter's disease that she inherited from Lyn.\n\nCat lovers will certainly relate drawing on their own experiences to appreciate how each of these independent yet loving animals helped the Horners through some of their most challenging times.

Lumet, who has directed a raft of important films, from The Pawnbroker to Dog Day Afternoon, has never topped this film. It's even finer than his own much better known Serpico.

There is something beguiling about them and at the same time they seem to want to say it all. Whether it is a characterization of Lizzy Bennett or it is Madame Bovary, each woman is almost a world in her own sense. There are also women who are caught in circumstances beyond their understanding and will and sort of emerge with different shades of personalities.\n\nThere are women who are single and lonely and need that extra bit of life so to say, something which will complete them. This I noticed in the works of Muriel Spark more often than not and sometimes also when Iris Murdoch wrote of them. The point that I am trying to get to here is that literature is full of these fascinating characters, one of them I will add to my list, after reading, \"The Woman Upstairs\" by Claire Messud.\n\nClaire Messud's woman is Nora Elridge. Nora is forty-two years old, a teacher and fully enraged at life, when the novel begins. She wants more out of life and doesn't know how to do it. She wants to get out of the rut and doesn't know where to go. She wants children. She wants a life of her own. She doesn't want to be the \"woman upstairs\" who is desperate and longs for more, as days pass, living in a house that has no one else but her in it.\n\nAt the same time, the novel jumps to five years ago, in 2004 when Nora meets the Shahid family and she begins to fall in love with each member of the family - Reza her third-grade student, Sirena the mother, and finally with Skandar - Sirena's husband and Reza's father. This goes on for a year, the one single year that changes Nora's life. This in brief is the plot of the novel.\n\nNow to the style of writing of the book. The plot is so well-layered that the mystery element of the book hits you unexpectedly and that to me is some great writing skill. The thin line between fiction and reality is explored brilliantly through this book and throughout it as well. Messud's understanding of her characters and the lives they lead is beyond excellence, because she delivers with almost every single word and that is what matters when reading a great book. Anger at all levels is reflected in the book in a very subtle and sometimes quite apparently. At the same time, there is enough intellectual depth to the book, which takes it away from being just another psychological thriller. As a reader, I was always drawn to Nora while reading the book. What would she do? How would it affect her? Should she do this at all? When a reader gets so involved with the central character, he or she knows that the book has done its bit.\n\nNora almost speaks to everyone and it is also frightening given the way she lives her life. One doesn't know what is beneath the surface, till it is either revealed or one is smart enough to catch on to the hints. You will love Nora and at times also hate her - that to me is a great sign of etching a character that everyone can or almost wants to relate with and yet maintain their distance. The ending is not tidy. Messud does not even tie up the loose ends. It is for the reader to decipher what could happen and what has. The psychological inferences are many and enhance the reading experience. The cultural inferences only add to those, making the novel richer by the turn of the page.\n\nThe book is profound, deep and at the same time touches on the concept of \"living\" like no other book I have read in recent times. If you are up to read something that will probably make you think a lot, then this book is for you.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "211621", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Summer is the daughter of two military parents, and even though everyone around her sees them as heroes, Summer cannot seem to come to terms with this fact.  To her, they are just her parents - people who are tearing her away from the first home she has lived in over several years that she has not wanted to leave.  Leaving her best friend Esmerelda and the people and places she knows does not seem like it will be easy, but there is no getting out of it.\n\nWhen the family makes the move to Valencia, California, Summer must learn to transform herself into a strong-willed young woman, as her entrance into sixth grade looms ever closer.  When her mom is deployed yet again, Summer grapples with feelings of anger at her mother for leaving the family, and insecurity at not being able to make friends during this transitional time in her life.  Eager to join the swim team, her parents sign her up before her mom's deployment, and she begins her competitive career.  The coach, in tune with Summer's needs, and trying to help her succeed to the best of her ability, gives his team pep talks.  His focus stems around encouraging his team to be flexible, fearless, and focused - three traits that Summer finds herself being more accomplished in as the novel goes on.\n\nHer flexibility comes about in terms of a metaphor that the author has injected into the novel - a hummingbird.  Early on in the novel, as Summer and her family first move into their new home, she comes across a hummingbird, which she describes to be \"fearlessly hovering\" in front of her.  She \"can't believe how fast its wings are - flexible - and colorful!\"  She wonders \"if their flexibility is what makes them able to be so quick and so fearless.\"  Watching Summer evolve as the novel progressed, into a smart, focused, and driven young woman constantly reminded me of the description of the hummingbird from earlier on in the storytelling.  Summer finds flexibility in her new life while her mother is away, she finds the courage to be fearless, and she remains focused on her goals, all the while remaining hopeful that her life will not veer too far off the path that she has liked it being on so far.\n\nVeda Stamps crafted a realistic, courageous, and metaphorical tale of hope, strength, and love, and I am eager to read more of her work.  The read was quick and full of encouraging ideas, as well as the normal middle school drama, that make reading young adult and middle grade novels so worthwhile.\n\nBeth Rodgers, Author of 'Freshman Fourteen,' A Young Adult Novel\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211622", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

In that light the use of science for the period is excellent except for the dinosaur's egg which is science-less. Also one almost needs to have read \"The Big Kerplop\" first to get the background but then time and events are not correctly sequenced. Still, these are boys' books, to be read for enjoyment and any science picked up is a bonus. Seven stories are related in this book, all are good stories, all seem humorous and the military friendly. The trouble I have, being an adult, is with the money involved in each story, where does it come from and essentially it is wasted. wasted in my terms, not burned or destroyed, but used in a frivolous fashion, not promulgating any benefit to the club, or the town or townspeople, mainly to play tricks. The sea monster is a farce, the big egg is non-scientific, The secret of the old cannon is competitive, but why do the boys figure they have to do it, why not let the town officials and did the reward have any bearing on the action? The unidentified flying man was a good example of a forced wasting of town money to no purpose but funny; and the gas bag race brought in metereology but could the readers follow it? The voice in the chimney was more wasted money, showing the rivalry between two boys' groups, and night rescue was too full of coincidences and a downed pilot completely out of his own rescue. Still I enjoyed it and I am sure mid-teens would get a big kick out of it. Worth reading to get a view of boys life in the mid twentieth century.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211628", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

At home I have a Logitech wireless external keyboard and mouse, a Western Digital Firewire 800 external drive, and a 22\" HP Flat Widescreen Monitor, so it is almost like having a desktop only cooler. I am a dual OS user (Windows/Mac) and I also have both OS on my Mac. Mac OS is by far the superior operating system. But, this computer runs Windows XP and Windows 7 (beta) fast. That's the good thing about a Mac, you can natively run Windows without emulation software, so there is nothing sucking up the processor power! Of course you can use VM Ware or Parallels if you want to run WIndows while running Mac OS which is also cool, but just not as fast. So, for all the people who cry about how expensive the Mac is, IT IS TWO COMPUTERS IN ONE, a Windows machine, a Mac, and  if you want to run Linux that too. Everything runs flawlessly in windows as long as it is either USB or firewire. I also upgraded my wireless router to an \"N\" device, and let me tell you, the router is in my basement and I am two flights up. I get a faster connection than with my ethernet cable plugged in (running 100 Mbps). My next upgrade will be an Time Capsule, though part of my external drive is partitioned for Time Machine, which works quietly on its own in the background.\n\nWhen I go out with my MacBook Pro I never had any problem connecting to Public WiFi networks. The computer simply finds what's available and asks you if you want to connect, it's easier than Windows wireless connections. I also must admit, that when going places, this is the machine you want to be seen with, it is just attractive. So far I haven't seen anyone else with this machine at the places I bring it, I see mostly older MacBook Pros, but the \"Black\" keys give away that you have the newer model, not to mention the slim aluminum case. The keys are lit from behind for dark locations, shut off in bright locations to save battery, and dim accordingly as the light changes. There is also manual control, but the automatic works fine. Same with the screen brightness. It adjusts automatically according to the lighting of the environment you are currently in. There is also manual adjustment, but I never touch it. It also dims during periods of inactivity to save battery power. The screen itself is just awesome, the best laptop screen out there. I am a fan of glossy screens, to me it just makes the picture more vibrant, so those who like the matte screen might be disappointed, since this model does not that.\nThe NVidia Graphics in this machine is top notch too, I use this laptop for video, and with the high graphics turned on, this laptop does a great job. A quick note though, if you are on battery power you will definitely want to just use the integrated graphics mode, since this will almost double the runtime. You will also want to turn off the bluetooth radio, since this also eats up a lot of juice. It's best to bring the power adapter if you plan on doing video or picture editing or heavy bluetoothing.\nWhen I go out, I use the trackpad, and leave the mouse at home. You get use to the pad quickly, including the gestures and lack of any buttons, it is quite intuitive. You just have to remember that the button is towards the bottom.\nThe only thing that is a \"con\" for me is that the DVD writer is only 8X and not 16X, but that is just a minor inconvenience.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "211637", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

At 20 years old she has experienced more than most her age.  She remains focused and determined. Moving to a new state, full of strangers, with a job she hates can be daunting and lonely. So when she passes a building with a help wanted sign she decides that it must be fate, she has to check it out. She needs the money, and is desperate for a second job. The building sign says Confess and the windows are covered in intimate confessions from strangers. Owen Gentry, the studio owner is desperate for help and when he spots Auburn standing on the sidewalk staring at the building, he hires her without a second thought.\n\n\"Are you here to save me?\"\n\n\"I try to tell myself again that this is nothing more than a coincidence.

Secrets, confessions that they won't admit to each other.  But as the story continues, and their relationship grows and changes, secrets and confessions will be brought to light.  When Owens secrets are revealed, Auburn has to reevaluate some things and take a step back because Owens past has the potential to destroy what Auburn is working toward. While Owen understands what Auburn needs to do and Auburn knows what she needs to do ... she finds walking away from him to be the most difficult thing imaginable.\n\n\"Some secrets should never turn into confessions.

The book is divided into four parts encompassing in total 60 short chapters. Part I What the science says explains what we know about global warming, what is causing it, and how we know it. Part II Whats actually happening tells us what is happening right now. Part III whats likely to happen in the future is about things we know will happen unless we change course as well as things that might happen if we don't change course. Part IV can we avoid the risks of climate change focuses on ways to mitigate the effects of global warming and ways to avoid it such as geo-engineering.\n\nThe chapters are short and easy to read and overall the book is a laymans introduction to the effects of global warming. However, the author provides a lot of references for those who want to go deeper. The book is very well organized and it can be used as a reference book, almost like an encyclopedia. Just look in the contents for the right chapter. The chapter titles are quite descriptive. Quite often the chapter titles are questions and the chapter content encompasses the answer. The book is also well written and it does not contain any overstatements. It focuses on the established and proven science and in general avoids speculation, unless it explicitly states that it is. This may actually make the book scarier to some people. The known facts and the quite likely scenarios are pretty scary on their own, at least for future generations.\n\nOver the last couple of years I have become increasingly interested in and worried about global warming. Ive studied the science behind it (I have degree in physics) and the evidence that it is happening is very compelling. Yet there is so much science denial and resistance to action in the US. My home country Sweden is handling this much better. I really hope this objective and tempered book could wake up some people.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211648", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It also makes it easier to work alone when working on the side of a building, being able to tack the paper in place with little effort.\n\nA small downside is that, if the tar paper is a bit bulged, the stapler will invariably rip it, whereas the more careful motion of a hand stapler would reveal the bulge before damage is done.

They are very much in love, as Luke even followed Phoebe from Australia to London to try and win her over. However, the tone of the book changes very quickly, Phoebe and Luke take Tommy out to play. As Luke steps away to buy ice cream for the family, Luke disappears.\n\nAs months pass and Luke is not found, we learn more about Phoebe and Tommy. Phoebe seems resentful of being a full-time Mom. She was an actress in a previous life, doing mostly commercials, but now she is unable to get even commercial work because she is unable to travel for jobs due to a lack of childcare and Luke's judgment of her for leaving her child behind to pursue a career. In the meanwhile, Luke's career flourishes and the focus is all on his success. He neglects to care that his wife is unhappy and struggling as a stay at home Mom. Phoebe turns to the bottle, concerning Luke enough to ask his Mom to stay with them for awhile and help Phoebe out.\n\nAfter Tommy's abduction, Phoebe suffers a mental breakdown. Despite her struggles adjusting to Motherhood, she is crazy about her kid. She will stop at nothing to find him. In the meanwhile, we learn that Luke is not the doting, faithful husband we once thought he was. Phoebe is cast as a bad, unstable mother in the media. However, she will stop at nothing to find her son.\n\nThere were a couple of things I didn't like about this book. Luke is portrayed as loyal and in love with his wife (since childhood, may I add). Yet, there seems to be quite a bit of sleeping around and infidelity on his part. Also, the ending was pretty predictable. I was able to figure out very early on who had taken Tommy.\n\nThis book is worth your read if you have some time to kill.

Language like:\n\n\"His eyes were eggs of unstable crystal, vibrating with a frequency whose name was rain and the sound of trains, suddenly sprouting a humming forest of hair-fine glass spines.\"\n\nI don't know what that means, but I love it.\n\nGibson builds scenes in the cyberworld in abstract detail, not patronizing the reader and not waiting, either.

In his book, Dusty explains the many different types of Tarot cards to use while studying, and mentioned that the Halloween Tarot deck follows the Rider-Waite deck pretty closely, which is the one he recommends for beginning Tarot study.  After one is proficient, one can then branch out and use the more esoteric decks.  Of course, with Halloween festivities still in my mind I just had to have this deck to go along with my 18 other decks.  (I am a Tarot deck junkie!).  I have to say, this deck does follow the Rider-Waite pretty closely, but using Ghosts, Imps, Bats, and Pumpkins for the suits in the Minor Arcana.  If you love Halloween, and want to have fun with Tarot, these are very entertaining!  They seem to be pretty \"dead on\" for readings, too.

It also has one extra feature that other weather stations with Atomic/WWVB Radio Clock do not have, and that is showing the strength of the signal. Simply soft push the WAVE button when in the searching mode, and it shows the signal strength from one bar _ to two bars = to three bars ' easily. It also shows ' for no signal.\n\nIn my apartment, however, I couldn't get any signal from WWVB station indoor. The only place it worked was on the balcony. Other issue is the brightness of the LED, because it only has two settings: Low and High.

This book chronicles the people he meets, their lives, their tales and how it all weaves into Tully's life which is interesting although not particularly focused. Tully becomes a fly fisherman, guide and then takes on the task of restoring a beautiful Bahamian lighthouse on a fictitious island. During that journey he meets a 103 year old Sea Captain named Cleopatra, as well as many Islanders, some pirates, drug dealers, and friends. The book meanders through his travels while on his way to his destiny, however this leads to many side stories and lateral prose that does not lend to a focused story. However, you are definitely made to feel as if you are in the Caribbean, feeling the sun, salt, insects, tropical rain, eating fresh fish and drinking decent liquor. Also, if you are a true Buffet fan you will recognize his lyrics sprinkled throughout the prose of this book. If you enjoy fishing and hearing tales about various boats, islands and the Caribbean you may enjoy this experience of being transported to the Islands for a vicarious read.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211659", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

At least she left a handful of opera recordings very much worth collecting:  Aida, Trovatore, Don Carlo and this Luisa Miller. Unfortunately she never  recorded Ballo and Forza, she would have been wonderful as Amelia and  Leonora di Vargas. In this recording of Luisa Miller her voice can be heard  at its best, true spinto singing in the mold of Zinka Milanov. She has  strong support from that fine baritone Vladimir Chernov, who sadly has also  been having vocal difficulties lately. Both are very moving as father and  daughter, and it's wonderful to hear two real Verdi voices together.  Placido Domingo in his second recording as Rodolfo is still in fresh voice  and totally involved. Is this the best Luisa Miller? Well no, there are 2  other recordings at least as good: the  DG Maazel with Ricciarelli, Domingo  and Bruson, and the DECCA Maag with Pavarotti, Caballe and Milnes. Katia  Ricciarelli was very special as Luisa, probably her finest recording ever,  and the great Renato Bruson was incomparable as Miller, if forced to  choose, this will be my favourite recording. The Pavarotti/Caballe is  marvelous too, especially for Caballe in one of her finest recordings, the  voice itself unbelievably beautiful, if not as touching as Ricciarelli. All  three recordings are admirable and worth owning.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211661", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

While each book followed a different set of characters, I knew that in the end they would intersect in some way, shape or form. Brightmores tales are dark and twisted, but its the romance portion of the story that I struggle with.  Each character seems to almost fall instantly in love with the male or female counterpart to the story. To me, there isn't enough build up or interaction between Aubrey and West for readers to really get a taste for their relationship.  Sure, they interact at the library and there are hints that this has been going on for quite some time, but readers aren't privy to that off page context so there isn't ample enough time to build a connection.\n\nWhile the romance fizzled a bit for me, the sex scenes sizzle.  Brightmore knows how to turn the passionate heat up between her characters and trust me ladies, this one is a five alarm fire. The dark and twisted portions of the story and the series combined are spot on.  You feel the intense emotions and dark intentions of these perpetrators and the painful writhing of the victims.  Having a background in law enforcement and forensics, there are some minor issues with how the crime scenes are investigated that bug me, but to someone who doesnt have a background in those areas, that wouldnt be an issue and likely overlooked.\n\nDenouement has its high and lows that honestly may just be due to my personal preferences or my background.  While this book may not have been my cup of tea, Im sure there are plenty of people out there that will enjoy the novel.  I understand the blood, sweat, and tears that authors put into writing their books and Im not one of those kinds of readers who will mark down every single little thing I didn't like or didn't agree with to nit-pick. Instead, I am just going encourage those who like twisted, dark romances to give this book and series a shot.  Every reader is different and its those differences that make books so magical so don't base your judgment on what one person has to say about a book.  You never know what might surprise you as you crack open something new.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211668", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Why have you forsaken me? Where o death, is your victory? Why do you seek the living among the dead? Do you not know these things.\n\nEach of these questions are rich and each question is answered fully in a chapter that engage you to thinking more deeply about Jesus.\n\nI find it interesting how Jesus asked John Do you love me three times and Jesus is asking his Father three times - Is there another way? Because it is a spiritual war taking place, a war between a holy God who hates sin and a unholy humanity that hates God and the hosility that is a result of that, the question is there any other way is more for us to know. Do you feel the tension between the world and God..it is for us know that there is no other way for justice to come. Jesus who is without sin, being fully man and God took our place to demonstrate His rigtheousness that He might be just and show mercy on us sinners. The cross shows the wrath of God and His mercy for us which leads us to the next question. Why have you forsaken me? Why did Jesus have to be forsaken by the Father? Was the abandonment of Jesus the greatest of his suffering. What does that mean for me and for you.\n\nAnother great question, do you actively live with the death of Christ in view or the resurrection in view and what does that look like. The resurrection adds triumph to the tragedy. Life lived in light of the resurrection includes radical sacrifices in faith. That statement is profound to me. That is thinking deeply of the faith we have in our risen Lord. What happens if we are not living in light of the resurrection, we seek the living among the dead. Our lives have purpose in light of the resurrection. And lastly, when we know these things and remember, we see God's providence.\n\nI really enjoyed this book and what I learned. There is much to be captivated and be in awe of the death and resurrection of Christ.

Plus he writes books about his travels.\n\nFar from a boring man. Plus he has everything, lives at the pinnacle of society, is highly regarded by pretty much everyone\n\nAnd yet\n\nWith her usual honesty, depth, and intensity, author Mary Jo Putney shows us a man with a core of loneliness and despair.\n\nHowever, this is no modern hero who indulges himself in endless angst and poor me suffering.\n\nNo, Carlisle does not inflict his pain on others, nor does he indulge it. It is simply there, and must be lived with because, he believes, there is nothing he can do to assuage it.\n\nYears ago, his beloved wife left him after only six months of marriage; she has not returned, nor has she communicated; and he doesnt have, as he says, the heart or stamina to take another bride, nor is he willing to go through a public and scandalous divorce.\n\nBecause his fathers health is declining, Carlisle decides to go on one more adventure, intending to explore along the ancient and still active trade route through Central Asian deserts called the Silk Road.\n\nJust before launching his journey, he encounters his mother-in-law, who begs him to save her son Ian, who is imprisoned in Bokharaa city so perilous for westerners that its virtually suicide for him to agreebut hes always liked her, and his wifes brother Ian, so he agrees to go.\n\nShortly after he embarks on the journey, he and his two guides are set upon by a group of fierce Turkoman bandits bent on killing Ross because he is a ferengi. His guides run off, but Ross cannot escape, and finds himself surrounded by fierce, implacable men with rifles aimed straight at his heart and head.\n\nUntil they are run off by a group of Persians led by a warrior of the mysterious, veiled blue men tribe called Tuareg.\n\n*spoiler on* He soon learns the veiled Tuareg warrior is none other than his estranged wife, Juliet. Who insists on going with him to rescue her brother. *spoiler off*\n\nWhat follows is a grand adventurefull of heart-stopping danger, from caravans and sandstorms, to the exhilarating and treacherous Turkoman game on horseback called bozkashi, to their own capture and escape so they can enter the black hole prison where Juliets brother might lie dying.\n\nIt is also a poignant and gut-wrenchingly painful emotional journey.\n\nThis is one of the best examples of this authors ability to explore the deep and anguished emotions of her characters through their relationship, delving down layer by layer, until they find their way to the essential truth, and to the possibility of healing.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211694", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The A6300 is an incredibly powerful piece of kit that, beneath it's very easy to use \"auto\" modes, has a plethora of often extremely useful shooting options that require explanation to understand. It also has one of the most complicated & opaque on-board menu systems I've come across and an instruction manual that's close to useless. Gary Friedman's excellent book is, in essence, a detailed and very clear user guide that carefully walks you through every menu option while explaining what it does and why you may (or may not) wish to use it - by the end of it you'll feel that you're in control of your A6300 rather than the other way round.\n\nSecond, if you're intending to use your A6300 for regular video shooting, to reprogram button \"C1\" that sits next to the shutter release as the video on/off button and to then set the camera up so that this button only works when the camera is in \"Movie\" mode - within a short time of trying to use the camera in its \"out of the box\" configuration you'll understand why these two changes will make shooting video so much easier. Trying to explain how to do this using Sony's labyrinthian menu system would take too long, which, of course, is why you need a guide book like Gary Friedman's.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211696", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I read Beautifully Damaged the Indie version months ago and fell in love with it. So when I found out that Lucien's story was coming out I was beyond excited because I really liked his character. Although, I do love Lucien now that I got to read his full story it's the delivery of the book I was a little disappointed with.\n\nI know every author has their way of writing a book and in no way am I telling anyone how they should write but I am entitled to my opinion. For me, this book had too much going on. I mean Trace and Ember had their story told in Beautifully Damaged so I think this book should of just focused on Lucien and Darcy. The multiple POV's which were not in first person is a little hiccup for me. I'm not a fan of third person reads especially if there is going to more than one character to follow.\n\nIt's all connected, I know, it's what connects the characters and brings the story to life but it was a little much for me. I liked the book, yes, a lot (I know that probably doesn't make sense but I really did). After getting over my little pet peeves and quirks I loved Lucien and Darcy's journey. It was emotional, heartbreaking and the passion and chemistry between them was beautiful. It was such an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nThis book is filled with love, suspense, heartache, twists and turns you will not be expecting. What I really do love about this book is that L.A. Fiore was able to draw me in emotionally and that's a biggie for me when reading. I want to feel the emotions the characters are experiencing. When they are hurting, I want to feel their pain. When they are sad and heartbroken, I want to cry along with them. When they are happy and content, I want to be smiling too. And she totally did that. That's what got me, that pull you feel when reading is what made me look past the little stuff and really love this book.\n\nDo I recommend reading this book? Yes, absolutely. It truly is a great read of raw emotion, heartache and second chances. I'm just a little picky especially considering the first book in the serious was absolutely amazing but this one was just written differently. However, I did enjoy the story line and fell more in love with Lucien.

I know this isn't a glowing review, but I only wish I had known it didn't give me that information before I had bought it and perhaps I'll prevent this book from being bought by a reader who can't appreciate it.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211714", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Telling us the story as she would tell her children. I can't imagine that anyone else would have been right for Steve in his lifetime. Terri and Steve had a connection that was built on respect, love and a mutual desire to make this world a better place for the animals on our planet. They were obviously soul mates from the moment they met and I really respect Terri and the strength she shows everyday in keeping up the Australia Zoo and following through with Steve's dreams for the future.\nMaybe it is because I actually loved Steve, maybe it because of the passion and enthusiasm he exhibited every time you heard him speak about animals, or maybe it is because I am an incurable romantic who hopes that that everyone could have a love like Terri and Steve. Perhaps it is all that and more or none of it. What I do know, is that this is a fantastic book, well worth reading. If we didn't already know what a special individual Steve Irwin is, Terri shows us why. She honors him on every page and I can only hope that she put out another book when she has had more time to heal. There must be tons more stories about the man who left this world as a legend.\nIt is impossible to imagine how she managed that first moment when she heard that her soul mate was gone. Having to tell her kids that their personal \"superhero\" would not be coming home is actually unimaginable to me. If he seemed untouchable to me what must he have seemed like to his children?\nI can remember the day I heard that Steve Irwin had died (I actually wrote about it on my son's blog). I was devastated and worried about Terri and Bindi. I knew that his son was too young to actually get the whole thing but if anyone ever saw Steve with Bindi, you knew that they had a love that was palpable.\nI found myself looking back at the pictures included in the book about 20 times in the few days it took me to read it. I actually talk about Steve to my kids often. We love watching Bindi The Jungle Girl and I am pushing for a Bindi birthday party for my almost 3 year old.\nI had done a 5th sentence meme on this book last week and seriously don't want to say good-bye to it.

Wish I could buy it somewhere else. If I had a chance to get my money back, I would not buy this model, I would have purchased the nice juice press instead.\norginal review:\nI have been using this everyday since it arrived about Christmas time. OK, I have another juicer, an older heavy juiceman. It still works ok for a centrifical juicer. But with green leafy stuff, it is not very good at all. SO.. I run everything care free through the juiceman, and then put all the wet pulp from that into my Angel. I get almost the same amount of juice again. It works much better this way because the feeder chute on the Angel is small, and the juiceman is about 2.5 inches. MY favorite juice is cellery, carrot, apple, a tiny bit of ginger, a half of lemon(half peeled), and kale or red chard, and beets. I love this stuff and can feel my vibrance and health increase as I swallow. Just wonderful. If you do not juice, you are really missing out on so many things those micro nutrients can do for your mind and body. Cheers!\nUpdate 6/12/12: I have been using the superangel 5500 for 6 months now and the screen is plugged up with a brown hard mineral deposit, probably some polyphenols, because of the amounts of chard and beets I juice. I have soaked it in vinagar, lemon juice, scrubbed with brushes. this stuff is very hard and will not come off. 80% of the pores are pugged in some of the areas. The brush is comes with is useless for this precipitate. Has anyone found an effective way to remove this deposit. It is not simple scale, is is very resistant to acid and the  only way I have found to remove it is to put a soft wire through each hole. This is not going to get it clean though, as there are thousands of holes and I just don't have the will power to poke a micro wire through each pore space. The customer service is completely useless and does not even understand english. Be aware that this is a good juicer, but if you have a problem, you ARE on your own. ANy suggestions????\na final word 12/17/12:\navoid this entire company until they start to respect the warranty and back up the product. I have babied and used the best care and judgement with this machine and it has failed me. I guess because I used it alot. NOw it is a 1100 dollar thing is a box with no screen.

Count me among their number.\n\nKillough-Walden has done an excellent job in updating both the story and the characters we came to know in the original tale of Peter Pan. Though she took some poetic license with the setting and timing (this story is described as taking place five years after the Darling children's return from Neverland, but is obviously set in modern times), it adds rather than detracts from HKW's story. I was pleased that she didn't try to write her book as a sequel to the original, but created an original of her own.\n\nWhat's to like: The updated characters. The realistic portrayal of parents trying to navigate their new and unexpected reality of dealing with what they assume to be the mental breakdown of at least one of their children. The kids themselves struggling to balance that which they know and all its implications with the \"normalcy\" the adults in their lives wish for them to find. The ease with which HKW turns from the \"real\" world to the world of pirates and fairies and former Lost Boys. The author found a way to update the story and characters we knew and loved as children in a way that never makes us feel childish.\n\nWhat's not to like: I felt that there was more the author could have said. although the ending is perfectly appropriate, this quick read could have been longer, allowing HKW to explore these familiar-yet-new characters to delve more deeply into their familiar-yet-new relationships. In particular, the love triangle that emerges could have generated a wealth of chapters I'm still longing to read. The Darling boys seem somehow incomplete in this tale, since the story belongs to Wendy, Peter and Hook. It works, but I will forever have questions that could have been answered.\n\nFour stars for a tale told well. And, as _Wicked_ has caused to turn a jaundiced eye on Dorothy, so _Forever Neverland_ will never let me look at Peter Pan quite the same way again.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211731", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

In the story we find an old vampire who is just living, not enjoying life and full of despair because he is the last vampire. He is the last because the enemy wiped them all out, very nearly Michael too but he survivedjust. Now he is alone, he cant turn any of the Dhampirs, cant breed and has no want for power..until he meets Claire. Her blood calls to him, he has never wanted anyone the way he wants Claire and one taste will never be enough.\nClaire was only trying to steal Michaels watch so she could afford her rent but there was something about him that pulled her into his arms, into doing things she wouldnt necessarily have done  but once the watch was her, she was gone.\nBoth Michael and Claire cant escape the connection they shared that night, he needs to find her because she is his tether she has given him his soul back and he can finally become the powerful vampire he is meant to be, he can create his race again but how can that be when Claire is human? Claire is thrust into Michaels world of blood and death as she becomes the target of an age old enemy who are determined to eradicate the vampire race once and for all.\nI really loved this book, it seems vampires are making a comeback lately and if they're all going to be like this then Im a happy lady! I liked the premise of the book with Michael being the last vampire and holding the fate of his race in his hands, we are given a few flashback scenes of Michael throughout the book to show what happened to them and why he was the only one left. Its plain to see that he is living half a life and is quite pitiful when we meet him, he even has to force himself to feed and all of the Dhampirs know that he is weak. Because he is the last of the ancient ones, he also carries the burden of being the one to hold all of the history of the vampires and the consciences of the slain collective and also the current dhampirs. This is a heavy burden indeed. He has practically given up hope when he finds Claire and it takes him a while to understand why he feels the way he does which gives Claire opportunity to leave, meaning he will have to find her. I thought Claire was a great character, you could tell she was a survivor and had those skills so she was never going to take the mating bond lying down. I like it when they fight like that, more times than enough the men are swept away with the realization that they have found their one and the women take some convincing which is so much fun to read. I loved the way these two clashed, both as stubborn as each other and unwilling to bend  that is until the bad guys came knocking. They definitely had the chemistry that makes you get involved in the relationship and that is topped with some nice sexytime and a great surprise.\nAs I said  the story was great and the premise too. I liked how the enemy was linked to Michaels past and how they made their presence known, there is also a few things to discover about the enemy too. Much of the story is about the relationship and how they get together, the enemy becoming more active and involved especially when its clear that Michael has found his mate but the story branches off for some of the secondary characters too which I enjoyed because I like to get to know everyone and know what is going on in all areas. This is done with multiple povs which I think enhanced the story here, it helped to build the other characters up so that you could get to know them more and also get into the mindset of the enemy who aren't short on their own drama either. There are also some great fight scenes and action throughout as Michael takes on anyone who means Claire harm, adding an element of danger that kept the plot exciting. I was very satisfied by the ending of the book, obviously with it being book one it is left open for more and book two seems set up so now just for the wait  great start though and Ill definitely be reading the sequel.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "211732", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

But this compilation is really shoddy and that's why I'm warning Herman fans . Mostly it's old. Look at the date: 1990. This was still early for CDs and the sound was wretched. That's why there was such a rush to remaster CDs from around 1999 on; the labels were embarrassed by the sound. Also, not much care was given to 60s material; the groups were considered passe and it would be a decade before high quality reissue labels arrived on the scene. Fans will note that the songs aren't even in the right order chronologically. The only reason it ranks high here and has so many reviews is because it's been around so long. People gave it good reviews initially because it was the only one around and were really thinking how good the songs were, not the disc.\n\nIf you want the Hermits hits please do yourself a BIG favor and spend the extra $5.00 and get the collection titled \"Retrospective\". It has all the singles, even minor ones like East West that are absent here, and late ones like I Can Take or Leave Your Loving, also not here. The sound is incredible, remastered by people who cared. And please note that both discs are by the same label, ABKCO.

In my opinion I felt that Jude D. delivered as she usually does and then some. I felt that she executed this novel very well considering how differently this one started than the rest of her books and not once did I feel as though our heroine was a slut, far from it actually. I have to say it was refreshing to actually cut to the chase, make no bones about being attracted to eachother and not have the heroine sit there and torture herself (and us)for pages upon pages with wanting to give in to her hero and finally succomb.

The author did a great job of giving small hints and clues throughout the story without giving away the entire mystery.\n\nThe romance was sweet and not too overdone. There was just enough to keep me interested without completely taking over the story. I also liked how it gradually built throughout the story instead of just being thrown out there.

I can't wait to see how their relationship progresses in the rest of the series.\n\nChira is an outcast and is not used to hanging around anyone other than her best friend Tasha. That is until she strikes up a a small friendship with the new boy Ben. She is a smart, loyal, and brave young woman that I enjoyed getting to know. I also liked seeing the growth in her character throughout the book. She started out as a bit of a loner, throwing up guards to keep people out. However by the end she had finally ventured out and gained friendships that she had never thought would happen.\n\nBen is an unusual, but very intriguing boy who has a very kind heart. He is very sweet and a bit shy, but once you get to know him he can be very charming. I enjoyed the banter between him and Chira they really knew how to make each other smile even when they were teasing each other. Ben also has a dark secret one that he doesn't like to talk about, but even so he does his best to try to protect people. He is a bit misunderstood, but it was so easy to fall in love with his adorable self.\n\nMatt is Ben's cousin and the last to join their little group. It was a bit tense with him and Chira at first, but with his carefree attitude and easy jokes it's hard not to smile around Matt.

Not only did he paint his own cover (which I found to be brilliant), he used his words to paint a story as well.  With all of the apocalyptic novels out there, I thought that this novel might not be as original as it could be, but I was very wrong.\n\nTurk's story and ideas are something that I have never seen before in a novel, and I enjoyed thoroughly the idea that humans are creating their own death traps.  Even though this novel follows the idea that the government and corporate officials are the ones creating man made disasters to destroy life, I felt that this was also a metaphor for how we as a race are destroying the earth and writing our own death sentences.  Joe Turk was clever with his words, and through reading this novel I felt as though each scene and character were being painted before me.\n\nFor my reviews, the biggest aspect that I judge on is originality and this novel received a well deserved 5/5 for that.  I didn't feel that I had read the story so many times before; instead, I felt that I was reading a story that was well thought out and had been mulled over for quite a long time.  In today's day and age, I think that this novel came at the perfect time due to the conflicts that we are currently facing based on how we have treated our planet.  I also think that Turk wanted the reader to understand that it isn't the earth that we should be afraid of, but our fellow humans.  However, this novel wasn't preachy and only presented the reader with a situation that is much needed at this time in the world.  I am gladly giving this book 5/5 and I am sure that, no matter what genres you prefer, this book will leave a lasting impression.\n\nIf you enjoy Dystopian/Apocalyptic novels, then this book is the one for you.

I must say that the cover drew me to the book originally, but when I read the blurb I was completely hooked. I can never resist two brothers fighting over a girl. There is just something about it that is so forbidden and wrong and just exciting.\n\n''In If I Can't Have You, fifteen year old Robin nearly drowns during her summer vacation in Paradise. Just when she thinks she's about to die, a handsome lifeguard, Drake, saves her life. From there on, Robin has this infatuation with Drake. Sadly, he only sees her as the fifteen year old she really is. He goes so far as to giving Robin a nickname: \"kid.\" This does not discourage Robin at all. For the next three years, she puts Drake on a pedestal. In Robin's eyes, no one can compare to Drake, he is her perfect guy in every way. Now that she's 16 going on 17, Robin is determined to get Drake's attention and make him hers before she goes off to college. But one more thing is getting in the way of Robin's plans; his name is Elliot and he happens to be Drake's younger brother.\n\n''Lauren Hammond really surprised me with this book. I wasn't sure what to expect, but  with what I read, I absolutely loved it. I've already said that this book is super addicting. It's such an easy and quick read that I was able to read this book in one sitting, in less than a day. Lauren managed to have me sucked into this story with Robin and I was more than happy to stay in it forever. It's set in Paradise, a vacation spot, that Robin goes to every summer. Not only does Lauren make this setting completely visual in my mind's eye, but she really brought the summer feel into the book. If I Can't Have You is a perfect read when you're lounging around near the beach getting a tan. ''\n\nI really enjoyed Robin as the main character. She's sort of keeps to herself, but she's not a loner and she's still able to have friends. She's not the most beautiful girl in the world, but she's got a good heart. Robin made pretty good decisions throughout the book. She's smart, thinks things through and she's pretty level headed. She had her mess ups and mistakes, but that's only normal. I thought Robin was more realistic because of these qualities. She seemed like just an average girl that anyone can relate to. What I loved was that I really could understand Robin and her infatuation with Drake. It's only normal at such a young age to see this person as her savior and believe he is all good and honorable. I get why she liked him for so long because I have been through this and I'm sure other readers will say the same too. I also thought that Robin handled certain situations with her head held up high and I was damn proud of her for admitting her mistakes despite the fact that it almost cost her in the end. ''\n\nAnother shining aspect of this book was the fact that I did not see what was coming with Drake and Elliot. I honestly believed things would go down differently than it did and I was more than surprised by the outcome of the story. I loved the twists that Lauren added. She also does a great job of making the Robertson brothers (Drake and Elliot) different. You can distinguish the brothers a part and I love that both have good and bad qualities that make each realistic. I especially loved all the steamy hot scenes that Lauren really brought into the book. I was swooning and sighing and just wishing I was Robin. ''\n\nOverall, If I Can't Have You was a spectacular read. It's humorous and filled with passion and sweet sweet romance that I couldn't get enough of. I'm definitely reading more books from Lauren Hammond!

Hamilton, for stealing the plot from Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Hamilton gives the reader two stories here, about a far future civilization that is menaced by dreams being sent from the center of the galaxy. At the same time, the reader is regaled with a 'dream' of a primitive civilization living a cruder form of existence. A faction of human religious fanatics (won't they ever go out of style?) want to fly into the galactic center to join the dream. And a coalition of alien races and human artificial intelligences want to stop them, for fear of what the 'God' in the center of the galaxy will do as punishment to the surrounding star systems. Sound familiar? All that's missing is Sybok, and a trip to El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.\n\nI truly wanted to believe in Hamilton's latest fantasy offering. After all, I re-read his entire Night's Dawn Trilogy, and that's something I've never done for any other science fiction author. In that series, he had 21st-century characters and more primitive types attempting to react to the modern galactic federation they found themselves in. It was a way to draw the reader into an unfamiliar setting. No such primitive analogue exists for readers of this trilogy. All the characters in the future are inaccessible, remote, and beyond anything we can conceive. And yet, people are still murderously amoral, just for more lofty reasons. Whatever. I found myself bored with the characters we were supposed to identify with and follow, and flipping past the 'dream' chapters whenever they came up. This distant future of humanity is all fantasy and no science fiction. He might as well have saved himself the trouble and made this a sorcery fantasy with the characters seeking a mysterious lair in a remote mountain. If you're looking for more of Hamilton's gorgeously realized hard scifi, steer clear of all three books. (I pre-ordered all three, and now regret it after the first volume).\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211762", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

In particular, I read all 600 pages in under two days, which should give an idea of its appeal.\n\nFor me, its strengths were:\n\n* It's a sprawling portrait of two (upper)middle-class English families, spanning a 20-year period, beginning in 1974, locating it firmly within Britain's Thatcher years. (I have a certain fondness for well-constructed family stories).\n* Hensher is really terrific at capturing the dynamics of relationships within a family, as well as exploring his characters' inner lives.\n* He can be very funny for long stretches; he can also write very movingly about intra-family tensions and loyalties.\n* With one glaring exception, the characters are believable, and he keeps us interested, even though the events of their lives, objectively viewed, are pretty mundane.\n* The various story arcs are well-constructed, believable, with satisfying resolutions (with one exception).\n\nSo if you like a nice, generation-spanning family drama that's a 'good read', \"The Northern Clemency\" definitely has something to offer.\n\nBut I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't warn you that:\n\n* The book could have been quite a bit shorter. At 600 pages, it cries out for editing. For instance, Hensley appears incapable of having one of his characters order a drink without telling us the height, weight, hair color and demeanor of the bartender, as well as what he's wearing. (There's a particularly egregious 4-page section later on in the book where an office cleaning lady, Rosalie, is introduced. We learn about her relationships with her heroin-addicted son, with the different security guards in the building where she cleans offices at night, with the late-shift supervisor, Brendan, her nosy neighbors etc. We learn that Rosalie has grit and is a survivor. But her only function in the story is to allow the reader a glimpse of something one of the main characters has thrown in her office wastebasket. And it's not even anything particularly revealing.)\n* Then there's what appears to be a mild food obsession on Hensher's part. Description of a fish pie can run to two pages. Canapes and appetizers receive similar attention, bordering on the fetishistic.\n* As a reviewer, Hensher has expressed his disdain for other authors' use of easy cultural references, such as pop songs, to evoke a particular point in time. He correctly identifies it as lazy writing. Apparently it doesn't bother him, in his own writing, to use vol-au-vents, shag carpeting, and the mention of very specific TV programs to do the exact same thing.\n* Although the book is set in Sheffield, against the backdrop of the miners' strike and Thatcher's response, there is no political commentary of any real depth. To be fair, Hensher may wish to make the (valid) point that even during periods of (relative) political turmoil, the interest and engagement of the upper middle class was virtually nil. But his development of Tim, the troubled youngest kid in one of the families as a caricature Trotskyite who is laden with every tired cliche in the book is  lazy and ultimately boring.\n* Occasionally, the plot just meanders into a completely implausible digression - there are parts when the novel reflects the often undirected, aimless character of everyday life a little too faithfully. I must confess that this didn't bother me all that much, as Hensher generally manages to keep things entertaining, and often very funny, throughout.\n\nI enjoyed \"The Northern Clemency\" a lot, warts and all, and found it compulsively readable. Readers who liked Jonathan Franzen's \"The Corrections\" should enjoy it; if you hated \"The Corrections\", give it a miss.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "211767", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Instead what we have is a uniquely animated drama based loosely on the classic source material from anime masters, Gonzo.\n\nReleased for the first time ever on DVD, Romeo x Juliet from Funimation breaks the 24 total episodes into a pair of two-disc sets.  The first of which (reviewed here) is known as The Romeo Collection and contains episodes 1-12.  Packaged within an appropriately artistically decorated cardboard exterior slipcase is a pair of thin disc cases each containing a single dvd (with 6 episodes on each).\n\nTotal runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears a conservative TV PG (13+) rating, based presumably more on the grander adult oriented themes (we do all know how this tale will end) than it is language, sexual scenarios, or gore.\n\nLanguage options are standard fair sub & dub meaning the original Japanese dialog track is presented (in stereo) as well as the option of instead watching an English dub (in Dolby Surround 5.1).  Finally English subtitles are available with either vocal option.\n\nTo paraphrase the opening set-up:  The story takes place once upon a time, in the sky continent known as New Verona where the all-powerful ability to hover in the distant sky breathes life and prosperity upon the people. However, foolish passions will someday transcend eternity. Now let me introduce to you the tragic story of innocent pure love tormented by fate in the midst of chaos, Romeo and Juliet.\n\nIn the event that this doesn't help you understand the story better, imagine a blend of European 1600s culture with some mythological elements peppered about for greater intrigue.  The main source of transportation on New Verona happens to be winged horses and let us not forget that this continent is in fact floating high in the sky.\n\nJust like with the play, Gonzo structured the classic Montague versus Capulet struggle as the immediate and driving force of the prose.  However the show does take some interesting liberties fairly early on in the form of young Juliet donning a wig and mask to pose as a male superhero who delivers justice in a severely corrupted and hierarchal society.\n\nThe star-crossed lover angle between the lead characters takes little time in starting but develops quite slowly; oftentimes painfully so.  There is little doubt that this show could have succeeded as a 12 or more-standard 13-episode show but was pushed to 24 due to Japanese broadcast television specifics.  As such, expect some story threads to fizzle out and others to drag on needlessly.\n\nIn the spans where things are progressing smoothly, the lead characters and their motivations are quite well done (save perhaps for the few times a wig can completely baffle everyone to the fact that Juliet is a female; especially when Romeo and his winged horse encounter the \"male\" version).\nVisuals are definitely high budget Gonzo territory and this fact is clear nearly immediately.  The character cells maintain a sort of washed out appearance that adds to the feel of antiquity to the equation while the backgrounds are lavish and rich with impressive lighting effects throughout.\n\nSound work is solid with a dub that succeeds on some levels but fails at others.  A very deliberate approach was taken early on by the voice talents to eliminate the old-English speaking style of the original work but then often (and out of nowhere) a character will slip into a bit of clich&eacute; old style of speaking only to nearly as quickly recover.  The Japanese audio avoids these pitfalls entirely but comes off as lackluster in some of the key critical moments.  Choose your poison, as it were.\n\nMusic score is very appropriate with nice fluctuations at the tense moments and subtle inflections when things get delicate.  In all I came into the show with hopes of Gonzo having duplicated the effort that made Gankutsuou work compared to Alexander Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo.  Unfortunately, it appears as though the problem with Romeo x Juliet is that the source material on which it is based was simply too ambitious from the onset.  In effort to make a modernized tale of the Shakespeare play feasible, blown tender moments and miscued romantic scenarios were perhaps inevitable.  Still, you have to give Gonzo credit for even attempting such a feat.  In the end it comes off more as a minor derailment than a total train wreck.  However, suburb visuals, smooth music work, and deliberate pacing may make this one worth looking into regardless of how it compares to the source material.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.75}, {"id": "211769", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I'll update later if necessary.\n\nIf you're like me you've read way to many reviews on these and got a lot of mixed messages so I thought I'd clear the air.\n\nComfort:\nThey're not comfortable.  I'm an adult with a medium sized head and they're a tad too big on me after adjusting them to the smallest size.  They are still wearable but not an ideal fit.  They are also a little heavy.  After a few hour or longer gaming sessions I'd have to take them off for periods.\n\nThe Sound:\nI currently have a Bose 5.1 setup.  (those mini double speakers) These sound about the same as it.  If you're using your tv speakers you'll be blown away but if you already have a good sound system don't expect much.  Though I was geeking out when I plugged them into my PC and got to hear the difference between my stereo 10 year old harmon/kardon's and these.  I do wish these headphones had more base.  They have a little but they are certainly not as good as the beats by dre headphones I've tried out.  Also one little tid bit, the high pitch sounds come in almost too loud.  On one of the songs I listened to anytime they pronounced an S word the S sound was almost painful.  Maybe good for footsteps but not music.  One thing I'll give these headphones over my 5.1 setup is you can place sounds extremely well.  In Bf3 I got a nice extra kill hearing someone behind me.\n\nAlso someone mentioned a .2 sec or something delay in the sound - the sound comes out at the exact same time as my regular speakers so ignore that.\nCurrent setup, HDMI to receiver for my home sound, then the separate dongle with optical out (xbox 360) into the XP500 for headphones sound.  You can have both on at once.\n\nBatteries:\nThey eat your controller batteries (xbox 360) if you do the wireless chat as well as having a demand on the headphone batteries.  You plug a blue tooth thing into the controller which lets you talk via xbox live and it eats up your controller batteries.  The headset also takes 2 double A batteries.  I ordered a wired talkback cable&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Turtlebeach-X31-X41-X11-PX21-PX5-XP400-XP500-Xbox-Live-Talkback-Cable-Puck-Black-TB450-2181-01-Official-Replacement-Cable-NEW/dp/B008BVUOBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Turtlebeach X31/X41/X11/PX21/PX5/XP400/XP500 Xbox Live Talkback Cable Puck Black (TB450-2181-01) Official Replacement Cable NEW</a>&nbsp;to try and help with the battery thing.  I'll update if it helps.  As soon as you unplug the blue tooth the controller low battery indicator goes away.  Rechargeable batteries don't keep as much juice as fresh new batteries and mine were just not lasting at all... Update: the talkback cable preserves your controller batteries pretty well.  Use it instead of the Bluetooth.\n\nWireless Interference?:\nI have Verizon Fios and their wireless router with my wifi PC, wireless mouse and keyboard and they all work just fine with the headset in use.  THOUGH, if I walk to the other side of the room the headset will start picking up static.  Also a funny little bit, if I connect my phone to the wifi and start browsing pages on my phone, the headset will pick up static each time a new page loads.  So I guess it depends on what you have for wifi in your house.\n\nSetup:\nI felt it was kind of limited.  You have to use Optical cable to the wireless transmitter for surround sound.  It has an Optical in and an Optical out.  It also has the old Red and White in for stereo sound.  I believe you can hook your headphones up wired if you get a toslink to toslink optical cable (or you can buy adapters)  It looks like headphone cable end except it has an optical tip.  That's how I setup my PC to use its sound.  I have an iMac and all apple pc headphone jacks double as toslink optical cable outputs.  (I'm not an apple buff, I'm currently running windows on this thing, just had to mention)\nAnd of course for power there's a usb to transmitter wire.\n\nOh and you can only have one wireless headset hooked up, you can do another wired but one is the max for wireless on the transmitter.  Max 2, one wired, one wireless.\n\nOh, I did fail to mention it has blue tooth so you can connect it with your phone and play music on it that way.  Pretty cool.  Hold the blue tooth button down on the headset when turning on blue tooth mode and it should say blue tooth pairing (or turn it off first).  Then look for it on your phone.  It uses the chat (blue tooth) volume control, not the main one.\n\nProgrammable:\nDon't care, haven't tried.  Btw presets are just bad.\n\nI was thinking about returning them but I'll probably just hold on to them.  I mean they work so why not, can't say I'd recommend them to anyone though.  If you just want to spoil yourself and don't care about the money then maybe.  That's where I was when I bought them.  :)  But don't expect them to redefine sound for you if you already have a good speaker setup.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.94}, {"id": "211770", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I really wasn't too sure about this one and whether or not it would truly work especially if I tried my homemade fries but I was psyched to give it a try.\n\nThe minute this arrived we decided the kids needed to have some chicken fries and tater tots for lunch over spring break to test it out.  To my surprise this actually worked.  Because the air gets all the around the food instead of the food sitting flat on a pan, the entire piece of chicken (fries, etc.) gets cooked all the way around.  I noticed an obvious difference with the first batch although the kids didn't say a thing about it.  I will say if you use a lot of seasoning or something that drips easily this does require a bit more cleaning than other pans or silicone mats but nothing that a simple dish scrubby won't solve.  I haven't had an opportunity to make my own fries yet but I am even more psyched now.

Since then I have re-read it three or four times, but unfortunately, like the first time, without a great deal of pleasure. Put bluntly I find Antonia Frasers writing style downright tedious. There can be little doubt that her research is extremely thorough, regrettably she chooses to unload every last scrap of her researches onto the page like some school student over-eager to showcase the full extent of their knowledge. This is evidently common to much of Frasers work. Recently I heard her on BBC radio, reading from her autobiography, everything she attempted to describe was lost in a welter of elaboration and qualification.  Some reviewers criticise Fraser for a  pro-Cromwell bias. Contrary to this view I find there is barely a topic covered where Fraser does not display a strong subliminal pro-Royalist agenda.

Or will she be too timid to follow through.\nI found this book to be very impressive. It was entertaining to see Addie's transfomration through the book from timid little sister, to something more. I reccomend it to fans of Levine's 1st book Ella Enchanted. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. The only complaint I has was some parts where a tad bit predictable. Other than that it was great.

After a rough and cheesy start, I think this film starts getting good from the chili dinner scene onward. Chucky is like the Leprechaun, or an evil Santa or murderous Easter Bunny: something (a doll) we previously thought harmless, but full of harm. And, like the Leprechaun, Chucky has a sense of sarcasm and insult. Even though it's set in the ol' low-budget setting of one single setting for the most part, it keeps the viewer engaged, and ties things back to the first Child's Play film. It has a few jumpscare moments, and is mostly well-filmed and executed. It seems to have a level of quality for what it is that's impressive given it's the sixth film in a long franchise. Chucky's atheism and bleak philosophy on life (told via his little girl friend, Alice) is a high point.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211804", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I settled on this phone: Samsung A930.\n\nIt is not without its disappointments, which mainly reside beyond the everything-you-need realm. Any criticism I have revolves around the Bluetooth technology. It would have been nice to hook up the phone to my computer via Bluetooth, however, the Verizon system with Samsung seem adamant to not allow this. USB cable, which you can buy from Verizon for $30 extra, however, works great and works great with a freeware software called BitPim, simply Google it and download the setup. This tool downloads/uploads everything from/to your phone: pictures, contacts, etc. I am also disappointed with most Bluetooth headphones. The ultimate test is with headphones inside a car while driving.\n\nSamsung A930 has a lot of community support. The most impressive web site I found is ([...]). The discussion thread talks about secret menus, etc. Also more useful topics about Bluetooth, voice memo, camera usage among other things.\n\nThe camera, by the way, aside from taking snapshots and video stream, has a flash for taking better pictures.\n\nBecause of this camera's versatility and price, I bought another one for my wife.

It tells the story of a woman aptly named Phoenix Fuller and a man named Riley Stinson. As I began reading, I've never wanted to read a book so quickly and yet so slowly. This novel is compelling and intense reading to the core of one's heart - especially if the reader has ever had to heal from heartache and \"start over\" or \"begin again\". Heartache can take many forms - it knows no boundaries - it crosses lines of gender and socio-economic class without definition and the timing is often unexpected. Anyone that hopes or wonders about second chances in life and especially second chances for love might want to begin their path forward by reading this novel.\n\nI have read many of the novels in the Whiskey Creek Series and each time I've burrowed into the story, I ponder and muse that \"this one\" is my favorite. Then as a new novel in the series becomes available and I read the story, I change my mind and want to exclaim \"this one\" as my favorite. So until a new title is released, I share \"this one\" to savor, to hold dear to your heart, to delve in deeply to the vulnerabilities of the characters, to experience the courageous search for a path forward, to understand the depth of the love of a child, to cheer for perseverance, and to hope that love can be as resilient as it is in our hopes and dreams.\n\nAs with every novel in the Whiskey Creek series, there are characters from previous novels and once again the reader is enveloped in the strength of their mutual respect for one another, their genuine caring, and the depth of their friendships in good times and in sorrow. Without a doubt, Whiskey Creek is a special place where courage becomes stronger, perseverance and hard work build character, and life becomes richer with the blessings of friendship and love. I highly recommend a visit - you'll not be disappointed no matter the story you choose to begin reading.\n\nI mentioned this comment in an earlier book review for the Whiskey Creek Series but it definitely deserves mention again.  One of the special delights of the series for this reader is that each novel can be enjoyed as a stand-alone title.  There are some novels that are tiring to read as in order to move the current story forward, the author seems to provide a comprehensive review of the attributes and histories of all characters to date which interrupts the flow of the current novel and is more of a frustrating and distracting interruption to the reader - regardless if an independent title reader or series reader.  As always, I look forward to my next visit with the characters in the Whiskey Creek Series.\n\nI was lucky enough to receive a pre-publication copy of this title from the author to read and review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211821", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It painstakingly documents their movements behind the lines and their fates in the last years of the war. In the process, it slowly reveals the mysterious character of Vera Atkins, a Romanian-born Jew and, technically, an enemy alien, who recruited and trained women agents for the French section of Britain's Strategic Operations Executive.\n\n\"A Life in Secrets\" is a great piece of investigative journalism and far more exciting (and heartbreaking) than any fictional spy novel I've read. Each chapter takes you deeper into the layers of personal danger and bureaucratic intrigue. Leads seem to take the story in one direction, only for it to be derailed or redirected elsewhere. Just when you think you know what has happened, more information is discovered that puts a different spin on things. Throughout the book, the heroism and sacrifice of the agents makes you ache for answers about their fates. And you root for Vera Atkins' persistent efforts to account for and honor her missing agents.\n\nI agree with everyone here who has praised Sarah Helm's outstanding research and writing. The number of people she interviewed, the extensive war documents she quotes, and the multiple verifications she obtained to confirm information result in an extraordinary achievement. This book is so layered. It's not only an important history of Britain's spy network in France, it's a major biography of the mysterious Vera Atkins. It includes dozens of shorter biographies of secret agents, military officers, concentration camp survivors, SS officers and prison guards. There's perspective on the deteriorating circumstances of the Jewish community in Romania and Hungary in the 1930s and lots of information on the war crimes prosecutions in 1945-47.\n\nMy only warning to readers is to be patient and really take the time to carefully read this book. The large numbers of people, places and times can be daunting to keep track of but your patience will be rewarded. I've read it twice to fully appreciate it. The Anchor Books edition includes a map and list of characters at the beginning which are helpful references. Highly recommended.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "211823", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It's simple and quick, but save yourself some grief: do it before you start putting data on it.\n\nI haven't used the drive long enough to give it 5 stars, but I gave it 3 stars for the rather dumb idea of formatting it FAT32, forcing many of us to reformat the drive.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211846", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I bought a 2000 lumen one which burnt through batteries in 10 minutes, several white smaller ones (you can see them in Amazon as ruby red round ones) which are great for getting people to notice you, but pretty poor for lighting up the road, and another 300 lumen torch, which I lost just prior to a bicycle tour!  So after a search through amazon, I bought this set of lights based on the price and how many lights they include in the pack. Overall it is quite good, but not perfect.\n\nThe Good:\n--------------\n\n- Price - 4 lights for about USD$40. Don't often see a waterproof light fornt or rear for USD$10. Good value. Certainly can do worse.\n\n- You get 4 lights. For night cycling, the more lights the better. The lights have 2 aims....to make sure cars and see you and not hit/kill/cripple you, and to see the road ahead. I've never understood why people use a single tiny dull light on each end of the bike. Cars have huge lights to avoid being hit by 1500kg hunks of metal. Why shouldn't you? I've put a light on my wheel spokes too for side visiblity. 300 lumens is the minimum for good illumination to see the road in front of you on a dark road.\n\n- Quality. The front and rear lights are well made and waterproof. The front light holders seem quite cheap..or at least lack refinement. Screws were rusty at box opening. Other reviewers have noticed this as well. Lanyards on torches are ok, but one with a sliding piece which can tighten around the wrist would be better. I will be using these torches for hiking at night too.\n\n- Rear lights have several settings and the silicone is opaque so light can be seen in all directions. not just the back. TOrches only shine light at the front.\n\n- Presentation counts. The box is attractive, no manual inside though. All lights firmly held in place in their foam insets.\n\nLess Good:\n---------------\n\n- the rear lights only have a single clip. It cannot be adjusted for wrapping around thinner parts of the bike. So if you have a bike rack which attaches to the seat post, or a normal rack but carrying a load, then the light can't be attached, or can't be seen.\n\n- the front torch holders do the job, but do not allow rotation. I like to turn my lights a little to the side so I can spread the light wider, and so cars on the side have a better chance of seeing me.\n\nOverall it's a decent buy for some reasonable bicycle lights. I've changed my torch holders and have a pretty nice set up now.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy your night cycling!\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211855", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I also like the little tripod it comes with.  It's sturdier than it looks and is adjustable.  The only downside is that this is pretty sensitive to ambient noise so if your fridge is running in the background while you record audio, you will be able to hear it if you listen carefully.

I like them because they are the first pair he's gotten in a while that fit him properly. The shorts come just slightly larger than we thought they would (but we ordered a size larger because we thought they would be small) and are actually rather slenderizing--there is no bulging,and no balloon-like legs. I think they look really nice on him. Some guys may not like the extra length, but my husband has been wearing longer shorts for several years, and he happens to like the length of the fit. He also is especially in love with all the accessory pockets. He doesn't wear shirts with pockets, so anything he takes with him (wallet, keys, etc.) has to fit in his pants or shorts. There are so many different sized accessory pockets on these shorts that he has plenty to choose from, and will never go lacking. The material they're made of is crisp and clean with a good slate-gray color. The zipper works perfectly, and adding to my husband's joy, the shorts come with their own belt, too. These are perfect for going out on the boat, for casual wear to a sports restaurant, or simply lounging around the house.

Once I finish, I forget that I needed better light there until later.  So when I was offered the chance to try this light out at a discounted price in order to test and review it, I had all kinds of ideas about where to use it.\n\nFirst, some of the reviews I've read have knocked this light because they feel it's not very bright - but in my opinion, this light isn't built to light very large spaces, and I don't think it's described as being able to do that.  Second, I've seen some complaints that it doesn't sense as far as described - and I did find the same thing in some situations.  When coming straight on at the light, I do have the light come around 9ft, probably most reliably at a little closer.  However, when coming from the side, I didn't have quite as good results.\n\nBecause of that, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, however, for how we use the light, we'd give it 5 stars.  We have this in our \"tech nook\" which is a ~2'x4' recessed space in our laundry room that holds our routers, audio receiver, DirecTV box, etc.  Because this is at the back of the room and goes off to the side, it never has enough light.  We have wired shelves in this space and so put this little light directly above the space with all the wiring and connections, so whenever we have to come in to reset the router, check a connection or whatever, and reach into the space, the light comes on.  Perfect!  The attached photos show the light on while the rest of the room is completely dark.  Pay no attention to our messy wiring.  And dust...\n\nI can also see uses for this in many other places - we have a corner cabinet that we're pretty sure has a secret space in the back that we've never seen.  This little light would be perfect in there.  I also tried this as an under the vanity (toe kick area) light - when you walk past it, the light comes on, bright enough to light up the space, but not so bright you are blinded.  I almost forgot to mention that this light comes with a magnetic strip that attaches to the back of the light.  This strip has adhesive on the back side, so you can place the strip anywhere you like, then attach the actual light magnetically to the strip.  This is nice for two reasons - one, it makes it really easy to change batteries without having to take screws out or try to do it with it mounted.  The second, it also makes this little light a handy flashlight if you find that you need some light in a different spot.\n\nOverall, I am really pleased with this light - I really want to give it 5 stars, but because I do see that there could be some conflict in the range of the sensor and this could be important to some people, I feel like I should give it 4.  If I buy others and use them in different applications and find that the range is further than I have realized with this particular one, I'll update my review very happily.\n\nAs I mentioned, I did receive this at a discounted price, but I try to review any item as if I bought it at full price.  I use Amazon reviews extensively for my own purchases and want to do my part to keep them as pure as possible.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "211866", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The first two were pretty good, but I found the third one, which took place in a hospital and hospice setting, to be predictable and contrived.  I didn't particularly relish Alton's \"protector\" status relative to Mallory, which was reiterated throughout the stories over and over, nor did I feel that the idea of saving themselves for marriage added anything to the relationships or the stories It could have been omitted altogether, keeping the reader guessing. Unless the author was trying to appeal to a \"family values\" readership, it didn't add anything to the plot, and came across as contrived and irrelevant.

But it suffers from self-inflicted wounds -- problems that could have been avoided by simple changes in firmware -- that limit its utility needlessly.\n\nWhile I don't find the lack of a TWAIN driver too much of a handicap, there is a major limitation in its ability to scan many documents well: lack of a grayscale output. Monochrome documents are automatically output as black-and-white (1 bit/pixel). Depending on the typeface, this can severely degrade readability and suitability for OCR. It also means that continuous-tone images reproduce very poorly.\n\nPaper handling is fairly good. It does jam fairly frequently but is easy to clear and usually does not tear up the paper. However, it automatically outputs a file at the end of each batch scanned, which means no more than 50 pages. When scanning a longer document you have to merge successive files.\n\nDon't plan on using your computer for anything else while the ScanSnap is snapping -- it ties up your computer fairly thoroughly.\n\nWill O'Neil\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211868", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

While I was reading this book I lost myself in Addies journey. The author did an amazing job with the development of the characters. Depression and suicide ideation isn't an easy subject matter to write about but the author did an amazing job on it. I felt the authenticity and struggle these characters had through her words. I loved that the story also provided resources for anyone seeking help. Wash Me Away is told in First person and is told through Addies POV. While this books deals with serious issues, it also gives us a remarkable story on how these issues can be overcome and life can become enjoyable again.\n\nAddie is living with her Aunt Jane and Uncle Gil after losing her father in a storm. Addies life is not at all what her aunt and uncle thought. She has never spoken to anyone about her life with her father Thomas. Just before she is scheduled to start school at Burton Academy, her aunt and uncle want her to speak to a counselor about her feelings. Unbeknownst to Addie, she befriends Leo who also attends the Academy. Addie is not used to having friends but on her first day she becomes friends with not only Leo but Julia and Miyagi. The four become very close and establish an easy and natural friendship. They help Addie focus on her new life rather than her past life. Of course I helps that Leo is around, even though he has a girlfriend.\n\nAddies character is one that I loved. Even though she was damaged by her past we see her grow throughout the story. It is not easy for her to see her friends have loving parents when she lost her mother and a young age, and life with her father was nothing like people thought. At her new home Addie finds letters from her mother and she begins to learn the truth about her family. I loved the eagerness and focus Addie takes when she reads these letters. Just when she starts to get comfortable tragedy strikes the group of friends. Miyagis sister, Willow commits suicide. They are all having a hard time dealing with it, but the reasons for her suicide leaves Julia and Addie confused. Addie starts to see that Willow and her have more in common that she thought. Addie learns of a family secret that changes her already shattered existence.\n\nWe do not get Leos POV but you can see how special Addie is to him. Even though he has a girlfriend, there was no doubt for me on where his heart and head are really focused. The connection and chemistry between these characters is strong\n\nYou know you're not like most girls.\nFrom this angle, it appears Im like most of the girls Ive met.\nI don't mean like that. God not, you're beautiful. What I mean is you're different because you are easy to talk to.\n\nAddie will have to find a way to accept the truth which can very well be the last straw to her already fragile mind. The things this poor girl has endured and lived through will break your heart. I loved the way the author wrote this entire story and how well the characters were woven in perfectly. Each of the friends are dealing with issues of their own and I loved how their strange friendships helped them to deal with the realities of their own lives. I loved how they find solace and peace together.

For a long time, especially when I worked with Spanish-speaking ministries, I recommended pastors invest in a Thompson Chain (RVA version, standard Spanish for those who don't habla)because of all the study aids. The ESV, even if you don't like the translation, has a lot of nice articles, charts, etc. I'm not big on Bible study notes, but this one is pretty good. Which leads me to the only thing I don't like about it: it's thicker than my head. For study it's great. For carrying around church or to the pulpit, it feels like a ton.

As I read I thought I had read something similar, then it clicked, I had already read number 3 in this series last year and loved it. :)\n\nThis first part tells of Diana, having been rescued after a date turns nasty. The 'date' decided she needed to be punished and as Diana flees she is rescued by Ryker. An Alpha wolf from a pack that generally avoids any contact with humans. Rightly so in this instance.\n\nThe bad guy is somewhat of a religious nut, who believes all being other than those blessed, are pure evil. Sadly, that seemed to include women he took on dates. Thus my realization that I knew Gwen's character from the 2nd book in this series. :)  There is a lot going on in this book, as it's not just about the main characters, but the pack as a whole and past issues that have led to their current isolation from humans.\n\nIt's quite emotional as well, with the past brought back for those who were hurt. I will admit to being upset when one wolf is shot, as I'd kinda hoped she would become Stryde's mate. :) Thankfully I will look forward to reading no. 2 for his story.\n\nLiv Brywood takes us on another journey with these characters. It is very different from the Bear series, not so light-hearted, so be prepared readers!! :) I loved it. There is plenty of back story on the wolf pack and history, along with the current events. It all flowed so well and was another great read for me.

We live on hilltop 80 miles away (as the crow flies) from the major transmitters, with a row of forested hills between us and the valley. I never expected to get anything, but I made a valiant try.\nI bought 3 different antennas - a flat indoor antenna that did absolutely nothing indoors, but did pick up a few stations when placed on the back balcony - however it was not great and wasn't meant for the outdoors.\nI then tried a rooftop mount that resembles the saucer section of the Enterprise and it picked up a lot of channels, just not reliably. My signal strengths were in the 20's and 30's but need to be above 50 to be considered stable.\nI then got this one and at first I had nearly identical performance - even when elevated on a pole at the top of the roof. Finally I decided to take this one off the roof in favor of the more aesthetically pleasing dish antenna. As a last ditch experiment I tried it again, but from my balcony instead of on the roof. I have no idea why, but my signal strengths all jumped by 20 points. I know get 48 channels, about half stable. At a distance of 80 miles I get totally solid HD from 3 of the 4 major network.\n\nThe lesson I learned, that I want to pass on, is to note that this antenna does a great job, but is VERY sensitive to positioning, so like I did, do a LOT of experimentation if you're on the fringe. If I move my antenna to any other location or change any axis by more than an inch or two, my signal drops considerably, but if you can find that sweet spot, this antenna does an amazing job. If you live a lot closer to the transmitters, you'll probably love this smallish, lightweight, inexpensive antenna.\n\nGood luck!!!\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "211895", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Like almost everything in his book, the statement should not be taken literally. Just as a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis is not required to appreciate the Hebrew bible, this alternative bible begins to make some sense only when you get the metaphor. Everything is known because human nature is what it is. Because we are human, we make the same mistakes over and over. History repeats. And, it repeats. And, it repeats.\n\nMarquez's man-made bible history tells you that you do not need his or anyone's written history book to know that pre-historic mothers cried for their future warriors even as they nursed them. Marquez wants you to know that you don't need a bible or a crystal ball to tell you that tomorrow's righteous dads will again be sending their brave sons into some bloody conflict somewhere. Everything is known. The past, the present and the future, it's all known. Marquez lays it out for you in this bible. It's not an easy read. Despite brilliant uses of ironic humor, despite a masterful use of language---really more poetry than prose---, despite the occasional hints of hopefulness, the message comes through loud and clear: Life's a bitch and then you die; after that there is nothing.\n\nNow, go have a nice day.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "211900", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Then MacArthur breaks down the structure of the book and comments on most verses.\n\nThe book is designed to be an introductory commentary.  By that I mean, this is designed for the layperson who may have never picked up a biblical commentary before.  It's short, sweet and to the point in virtually every case.  And there are also many helpful charts, maps, and other goodies that are a good complement to the commentary.  So, it's also a helpful resource tool for a Sunday School teacher, part time pastor or the educated layperson.  Despite my three star rating (which isn't a 'bad' rating, per se), I think a lot of Christians would benefit from having this on their bookshelf.\n\nAny negatives from me are purely personal reasons that will likely not apply to anyone else, though I will briefly mention them.  I'm not particularly crazy about MacArthur's writing style.  I think it's often too terse and many times throughout the book I find myself reading things that MacArthur asserts that he should be more cautious about - he seems to speculate on many things that I'm not sure we have certain knowledge about.  It's kind of like Norman Geisler does with some of his writings (if you're familiar with any of his works).  And at other times I think he reads his theology into certain texts.  I think he does this with the warning passages of the New Testament, for example.  But, these are small critiques and don't affect the overall quality of the book.\n\nWhy the three star rating?  Well, I've read many basic commentaries in my day and so this is white noise for books that I read, but that doesn't mean I don't think it's an objectively helpful resource to have.  The rating system on here is one of personal preference, and the three star rating literally says \"It's okay.\"  And it's in that vein that I'm rating this three stars.  It's 'ok' to me.  It didn't knock my socks off and I knew what to expect so five stars just wasn't in the bag.  But it's nothing personal, and to be honest I think its high rating on this page is consistent with the book's quality.\n\nThere are virtually no downsides in any objective fashion that I have to mention.  I'd definitely recommend this.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "211921", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The tone of \"Temple of Love\" is a bit more whimsical and spacey than that of previous albums, with more synthesizer ambience and less emphasis on drum beats.  Kim Waters' voice glides and croons above a symphony of gentle instrumentals, overdubbed by Hans Christian on a multitude of stringed instruments ranging from cello and Scandinavian nyckleharpa to Indian sitar and sarangi, not to mention keyboards and ethnic percussion.  Though unique unto itself, Rasa's music was developing a tendency to all sound the same after a while.  This dreamy, laid back album is a welcome departure, with some new modes and melodies, and different orchestrations.  That being said, the first track \"Jaya Radhe\" (while not at all the same as the similarly named \"Jaya Radha\" from the previous album, \"Shelter\") does sound very similar to something I remember hearing on an earlier release, but I can't place it.  The other songs, however, are fresh and new.  For more by Rasa, try \"Light and Spirit,\" Hans Christian's solo venture into the world of Renaissance polyphony, with his unique blend of cello, nyckelharpa and sarangi overdubs in tow.

Project X refuses to fall into this simple-minded trap. Edwin and Flake, the two teenage characters in the book, are portrayed as the complex personalities that people really are, and not the easily categorized stereotypes that people tend to see each other as.\n\nThe protagonists in Shepard's book aren't simply misanthropic loners by choice. They are bullied and harassed on a daily basis, in and out of school, by people they know and complete strangers, and by adults as well as teenagers. The toll of this repeated physical abuse, egged on by their inability (both physically and emotionally) to fight back, forces them to withdraw from society. But they aren't presented as pure victims of an uncaring system. Their self-imposed alienation and inability to explain their situation to someone who could assist them, coupled with increasingly anti-social and reactionary behavior, just makes them easier targets and escalates the situation even further.\n\nIf this were just about bullies, the playgrounds across the country would be a never ending battlefield (and for some, it is). There are often other influences involved, and Shepard exposes some of these as well. The psychological instability of both characters is well displayed, but never left as a final scapegoat. Allusions to a previous head injury possibly causing some of Edwin's emotional problems, as well as Flake's apparent sexual confusion and sometimes aggressive domination over Edwin in their friendship, add to the pressures and overwhelming confusion. It is all too easy to forget that some kids live with stress levels that often drive adults to nervous breakdowns.\n\nShepard doesn't just trap these characters in a world where no one cares about them or notices the problem. Edwin's parents are well aware that their son is troubled, and try to both understand and lend emotional support. But their awkward attempts to reach out never manage to break through the confusion and despair. Their rebellious behavior makes Edwin and Flake an easy target for the scorn of teachers and other adults, but even some of them attempt to help through positive reinforcement, and enrolling Edwin in an after-school program for troubled youth.\n\nThe true brilliance of Project X is that Shepard manages to easily evoke sympathy, and even empathy, for Edwin and Flake. Most readers will no doubt find themselves not only wanting to help them, but wondering what could have been done differently. Through fictional characters and events, Shepard is giving the reader a glimpse behind the curtain that hides most of these kids until it is far too late to do anything but pick up the pieces and wonder to ourselves what went wrong?\n\nI have read other reviews of this book, and I am surprised by two common reactions to Project X. One is the repeated comparison of Project X to Vernon God Little, which is unfair to both books. Vernon God Little is a great book in its own right, but only uses troubled youth as a foundation for its story, and in no way attempts to expose or explore the serious issues that Project X does. This is almost like comparing Gus Van Sant's Elephant to Napoleon Dynamite.\n\nThe other reaction is from those who complain about the book's ending. Some readers wanted more about the aftermath of the events at the end of the book, and felt the need for closure. I feel that these people missed the point entirely.\n\nProject X is not about school shootings. It isn't about the victims or their families, the assailants or their families, the media coverage afterward, or the attempts by those affected to somehow pick up the shattered remains of what used to be their lives. The truth is, there is no real closure after such a tragedy.\n\nProject X is about what happens before these tragic events. It is about the children who become lost amongst us, the demons that plague and influence them, and most importantly, what finally drives them over the edge. Jim Shepard knows the truth; the only way to save ourselves from them is to learn how to save them from themselves.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.75}, {"id": "211925", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Especially after reading the synopsis, and for the most part it did deliver.\n\nThey All Fall Down starts with our heroine Mackenzie who is just your average type typical girl next door, whose striving to get through school so she can get on to better things, such as college, to where the memory of her beloved brothers death, and split family might be a thing of the past.  But everything turns around when she finds out that she is part of the schools much anticipated \"Hottie List.\"  A list that only has ten of the hottest girls in the school, and Kenzie is still struggling to figure out how she managed to land on it...that is until the ultimate hottie himself, Josh, rolls up to her with a wicked smile that melts her brain.  Figuring the list is stupid, but could put her in the vicinity of Mr. Hottie Kenzie just goes along with it.  That is until the girls start having accidents...accidents that can't be explained, and when deaths start to occur rumors fly of a curse on the girls on the hottie list.  And if that isn't unnerving enough to Kenzie the bad boy at school now has his eye on her too, and while her blood may run hot at the thought of Josh, it's absolutely an inferno when Levi looks at her.  But all these thoughts go flying out of her head once the girls numbers start to dissipate, and she realizes she's next.  It's up to her and her loyal friends to help figure this mystery out before her time is up.\n\nThis book truly had so much going for it!  Great characters that you rallied for, and each supporting character had a great personality that matched their actions, and were totally believable.  The main character was written well, and the plot was very good!  I love a great mystery, and this book really did hold my attention until the end.  The love interest wasn't actually bad at all, and I liked how it was written.  There was no true insta-love here, and I enjoyed that immensely!  I get so sick of that or a total love triangle, but Kenzie knew exactly what she wanted, and wasn't afraid to go for it, and yet, she understood some things needed to wait as the death of the girls on the list was more important, so the author did a great job there giving Kenzie a logical head.  That being said...the ending.  Wow.  I didn't see it going there at all, and it did get cheesy for me.  Totally cheesy.  Was it still a great read? Yes.  It truly was.  It had me on edge trying to see if it was a curse of it someone was behind all these deaths, and then how the other clues could fit in to the rest of it.  And I really did not see this going in the direction it took.  Which were all great things.  However, the end was just way too silly for me, and the author left the end open for a series.  I wont' give the ending away, but if you are expecting ghostly encounters, look elsewhere than They All Fall Down.  With all that being said, I still do recommend reading this book as it did have a lot of the elements I love, with a mystery thrown in, a little romance, adventure, and a girl who will try her hardest to kick butt or think herself out of a situation, plus a great set of characters.  The ending sucked, but it's just because I was waiting for a ghostly ending or someone who wanted revenge.  Even without that element and the weird line it took it was still a great book!\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "211934", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It is filled with the type of subtle sexism that no woman in the workplace should tolerate for one moment and the author (and apparently her readers!) portray this as not only acceptable and tolerable, but even desirable!\nSpoilers below!!!\n\nThe first third of the book is all about a guy sexually harassing a woman at work and behaving horribly toward her while she acts like a brainless nitwit worrying about him instead of worrying about her work and behaving like someone mature and professional. The behavior of the guy is the kind of sexual harassment and sexism that should get a person fired. And this book is making it seem like that is what women WANT in the workplace. The author portrays Lucy as desiring the hated coworker's leering and ogling at her body and making sexual comments to her. And with no warning whatsoever the \"hated\" man grabs Lucy in the elevator and kisses her without permission or warning. And the author portrays this as a great sexy moment.\n\nWhile the last two thirds of the book improve in the fact that Josh (the hated man) begins to behave more like a normal person toward Lucy, Lucy continues to behave like a petulant child. She tolerates being leered at by an older male superior at work who tries to look down her blouse regularly and the author portrays this like it's a normal occurrence and something Lucy simply tolerates until finally JOSH of all people gives her the courage to say something about it. Nice sexist trope. The woman as helpless child who needs a man to give her courage and guide her.\n\nIn addition to describing sexual harassment and immature behavior as normal and acceptable in the work world, the author's depiction of the corporate world itself is laughable. Lucy works for a woman CEO but instead of having any real conversations with this woman, Lucy whines to her about her dating life. And Lucy's internal dialogue describes NOT the powerful woman's accomplishments, intelligence, or anything substantive, but rather, the woman's wardrobe and how much Lucy covets it. Is this for real?\n\nGirls, this book is trash. And not because of the sex scenes. It's trash because it portrays Lucy as a ridiculous child obsessed with men and tolerant of being belittled and harassed by male coworkers.

Edward has totally bought into the position of teaming with Ainsley as his practical society wife. He believes that he can manage a life with her and won't have to worry about the pain that he associates with a passionate love. The thing is--Ainsley doesn't love Edward and dreams of freedom to pursue expanding her florist shop. On the other hand, her rebellious and free spirit sister, Cecelia, has had a crush on Edward for years. Cecelia has decided to escape their mother by spending a summer week on a Wyoming `dude' ranch as a bachelorette candidate for the handsome cowboy owner.  The girls decide to trade places when their mother books Ainsley on a romantic cruise with Edward.\n\nRiley is the reluctant bachelor who has to entertain a group of bachelorettes. The scheme was his sisters' idea to increase the income of the ranch and use a dating competition to test the ranch for women to come to a dude ranch destination.\n\nRiley has always played the field and has no intention of settling down just to please his siblings who are struggling with the recent loss of their dad. Ainsley has no plans to fall for a cowboy. She plans to use the time investigating the ranch family green house.\n\nRiley isn't pleased to have to take several days to entertain eight overly eager women. However, he is quickly intrigued by the one woman who isn't fawning over him. Ainsley isn't interested in competing for attention but she has a hard time ignoring the sparks when she gets close to Riley. The other jealous women make nasty innuendos and start suspicious rumors to interfere with the growing relationship between Ainsley and Riley. Edward showing up to claim Ainsley as his fiancee only complicates matters.\n\nThis turned out to be a fun story and you sort of get a \"two-fer\" as you get Ainsley's romance and Cecelia's struggles to win over Edward.  The other female candidates make some good characters to dislike as they create conflict.  The writing style is easy and the plot is fun and engaging. Riley has commitment issues while Ainsley has fear of confrontation issues to overcome. Riley's siblings, a teenage boy and his sisters, are clearly characters who may develop for further stories. This is a good summer read for those who enjoy bachelorette antics and conflicted romance stories.\nTitle received from Forever/Hachette through NetGalley for an honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "211950", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I had to keep it down very low to keep the music from distorting.  If I turned the volume knob more that 25%, it sounded awful  I was not happy with these speakers one little bit.  I had heard much better sound coming from cheaper ~$25 amplified computer speakers before.\n\nI then connected the speakers to my other computer that has a Behringer UCA202 USB sound card.  The speakers sounded nice and clean, but still not that loud.  The bass was fine if I was sitting 3 feet in front of the speakers, but get up and walk out of the room and all you would hear is mids and treble.  I tried mixing them with my 400 watt sub and was able to achieve a nice pleasant sound mix, but still the speakers definitely were not sounding worth the $150 dollars that I paid for them.  Matter of fact, I was thinking \"they couldn't possibly be putting out more than about 20 watts!\"\n\nThen a friend loaned me their Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! Pro USB sound card and WOW what a difference.  Now these speakers sound better than my 2 x 50 watt Kustom/Powerwerks PA speakers.  I don't need to mix in the 400 watt sub either because these thing push out more than enough bass on their own.  Now I'm thinking, \"How can these things only be putting out 50 watts?\"  I have ordered 2 of those USB Sound Blasters and can't wait until Monday when they show up.\n\nUpdate:  It's worth mentioning that the default crossover cutoff on the Sound Blaster was set to 80Hz using the default windows sound card driver.  Since I had the CR4 speakers I changed the cutoff to be 75Hz and it made a big difference.  Later, I downloaded and installed the latest Creative Labs sound driver from their website and it made the speakers sound even better!  So don't just accept the default driver that windows wants to install.\n\nUpdate:  I have tried these speaker out in several different spaces and they sound there best in my small 9' x 10' office, about 8 inches away from the wall.  They fill my office with big booming sound.  You would swear they were big home stereo speakers with a sub woofer attached,  As for larger spaces, they are not big enough to fill my 16' x 24' family room with sound, nor are they big enough for outdoor use.  The mids and treble sound so much better on these Mackies than any of my other speakers I have in the house regardless which space they are in.  They sound amazing for the small size.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211958", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

She finds herself a square peg in a round hole, at odds with some of her peers and unable to come to terms with the recent death of her beloved childhood nanny. She finds solace with her (somewhat dissolute) friend Tabitha and her sister Carmen, but her dealings with her own mother - a cold and businesslike individual - remain a source of frustration.\n\nHer resignation from her job at the hospital becomes a catalyst for change, leading to an unlikely romance and the eventual emptying of skeletons from the family closet.\n\nThis is a heart-warming and well-paced novel. I found some of the switches from first person to third person narrative a little jarring at times and I guessed fairly early on where the story was headed, but none of this spoiled my enjoyment of the narrative.\n\nIf you like a good cry and a satisfying resolution to a tale, `Blessed and Betrayed' is a book for you.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "211961", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

From the very beginning we meet Marianne McBride, a computer geek who has always been one to follow the rules and do what she is told. Though she is good at what she does, she wants to get out of her shell, and her boss who also happens to be her best friend comes up with the perfect idea. Marianne will be hiding in a cake, and when the right time comes sing Happy Birthday to non other than her best friend's brother. Now that should sound simple enough, but when she is wearing the shortest and tightest dress she has ever seen while singing to her crush, made things a lot worse for Marianne. Needless to say, she does sing to him and after seeing his stunned face, she kisses him and runs away. She bows to never bring that subject again after that day, but secretly hopes that Nick did not recognize her.\n\nThe night of his birthday party will always be in Nick's mind, especially when he gets kissed at the end. Now he can't figure out who she was and it's driving him nuts. To add to his already crazy state-of-mind, his boss gives him the news that he is going to become partner only if he settles down. After receiving the news, he reaches out to her sister in hopes that she'll help him out, and she has the perfect idea of who to match him with. But Nick doesn't want an actual relationship, he only wants a fake fiancee, someone that is going to look nice beside him after meeting other executives. When his sister tells him about Marianne, he is taken back since she is reserved and a workaholic as well. But he doesn't have a choice, and so he agrees. When he proposes the proposition to Marianne, she only asks him to attend a family reunion in return for a six week engagement. Soon the pair is living together, and the more time they spend together, the more they start to like each other. Secrets get revealed as well and soon they both have to face obstacles in order to be together.\n\nI really liked the overall plot of the story, it flowed nicely and we get to understand the characters more after they start to get to know each other. They are both driven by their work, but together they balance each other out. Their chemistry is not instant, at least from Nick's POV, though he is somewhat attracted to her he doesn't find out who she really is right away. We do get to find out a lot of secrets and how they can potentially break the couple apart as well. All in all, the book was a total page-turner for me and quick to read. The ending was perfect, it totally fit with the story and tied things nicely at the end. I highly recommend it. :)\n\n***ARC provided by Entangled: Lovestruck in exchange for an honest review.***\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "211980", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Almost.\n\nI was afraid that with Faefever being the third book it would be an info dump of exposition. While it's true we get a lot of information, Karen Marie Moning tells it in a gripping, taut and thoroughly surprising way. Mac, Barrons and V'lane are still searching for the Book aka The Beast. They are still not trusting each other or sharing information and it's so silly. If only the three of them could sit down and talk, openly and honestly, it would prevent so many problems, but KMM writes a funny scene that dispenses with that idea pretty quick. It seems both V'lane and Barrons have a long and nasty history and although Mac is dying to know, they aren't sharing. It's almost as if they are fighting over her and the first one in her pants, wins. Since Mac can't trust anyone, she spreads her eggs throughout all the baskets she can find, including Inspector O'Duffy, Christian MacKeltar and Dani, one of her fellow sidhe-seers. Derrick O'Bannion makes an appearance, making nasty threats about the upcoming Halloween, and he's seen with an aquaintance of Mac and Barrons that's sure to have repercussions in later books. The Lord Master also makes an appearance. He's trying to wheedle his way into her good graces, just like all the other men in her life right now. This encounter prompts her to ask Barrons for help in resisting Voice, which allows for some interesting byplay and a powerful scene between the two of them. Barrons becomes a much more aggressive, brutal and enigmatic character than ever before while V'lane, however, turns into almost a pussycat. He's toned down the death-by-sex vibe and Mac even turns to him for bodyguard service. While this book has a dark feel to it, it's also arguably one of the funniest offerings in the Fever series to date. Mac and Barrons continue to hunt but she's afraid deep down, of whether or not she can trust Barrons to do the right thing if they find the Book. Improvising the best she can, she leads the men on wild goose chases, until one night, she can't hide her reaction from Barrons and they come the closest they've ever been to the book and Barrons' own arrogance and certainty is put to the test. When that proves futile, the only thing they can do now is help shore up the walls between Man and Faery, which means joining forces with the MacKeltars. Barrons journeys to Scotland to lend his own special brand of Druid magic and Mac stays in Dublin to try and help with her fellow sidhe-seers as they perform their own rituals. It becomes a race against time to keep the walls up and the horrors of the Unseelie out of the world of Man.\n\nThere isn't much to actually outline in ways of story except to say that everyone is in kind of a holding pattern. They are just looking for the book and waiting for Halloween, when Barrons and the MacKeltars attempt to rebuild the walls between Man and Faery. We learn a lot more about the sidhe-seer organization and the Hallows, both Seelie and Unseelie, plus the Unseelie King. Christian MacKeltar steps into the ring as another possible love interest for Mac, creating a wary, prickly threesome and speaking of threesomes, wow! I think it fair to add in my review that there is a three way gang rape in the end of the book with Mac as the victim. It was not pleasant but just know that in this reader's humble opinion, it didn't bother me in the slightest. Some people will compare this to an orgy a la Laurell K. Hamilton and it wasn't. It was not graphic or exploitive. It was pertinent to the story and to be honest, I felt like this was a long time coming. With all that talk about death-by-sex, it was time for an example.\n\nAhhh, Barrons. Mac says to herself during her many musings that she has apologized and made excuses for him in the past and it's true. He's enigmatic and evasive to say the least and in this book he's down right brutal. He lets go with his domineering, dark side a lot more in Faefever and I still think he's hot as hell. Some might say he crossed a line with Mac with his Voice coaching but like Mac said, she was just fooling herself as to his true nature. The layers are being stripped away and I for one, loved it. We'll just have to wait and see what lies underneath that impenetrable cloak of his.\n\nI really enjoyed Faefever. We get some more glimpses of the MacKeltars in this one and Christian is shaping up to be worthy of the name Keltar and with his long dark hair and golden eyes, remind you of anyone? Once again Karen Marie Moning teases and torments us with innuendoes between Mac and Barrons. I also felt there was an intriguing clue about Barrons' origins tucked away in plain sight. Oooo. Time will tell. While unfortunately there isn't much going on during this book, the humor and tension is still very much alive in it. The ending ramped up my excitement for the fourth book, Dreamfever and ahhhhh! It's going to be a year long wait!!!!\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.88}, {"id": "211990", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Lehrer provides his own introduction, as well as hilarious introductions to each of the songs. The album also includes two bonus tracks with songs that Lehrer wrote and performed for \"The Electric Company\" in 1972, and even though they were created to teach children to read, they still contain his trademark creativity and humor.\n\nThis album contains some of Lehrer's earliest material. Although it is less politically oriented than his later songs, it is every bit as satirical. The songs parody many styles of music including love songs, folk ballads, and football fight songs. As Lehrer puts it himself in the introduction to \"I Wanna Go Back To Dixie\": \"Well, what I like to do on formal occasions like this is to take some of the various types of songs that we all know and presumably love, and, as it were, to kick them when they're down.\" Many of these songs are shockingly macabre or raunchy, and considering when they were performed, they were well ahead of their time.  Even the liner notes are funny, and although they are not attributed to Lehrer, I have the feeling he had a hand in their authorship.\n\nThis is a short album, barely over a half hour long. I suppose this is because Lehrer wrote only about fifty songs in all before dropping out of songwriting to teach mathematics, so his songs are sparingly rationed out among a few CDs. But good things come in small packages. In my humble opinion, Tom Lehrer is one of the greatest musical satirists, and I highly recommend this album.\n\nEileen Rieback\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "211992", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The Chromebook is specifically designed to work with the Google platform (storing all of your data on the google drive is a quick convenient way to make sure you always have your files with you).  I started using the drive a couple of years ago, and have never looked back.  This product helps you to access those files instantaneously and easily.\n\nThe overall design of this product is great because it can function as both a laptop, with a full keyboard (which I love, and really miss on other touch screen devices).  If you are working on anything that you will need to type for this is a must have feature, it also functions as a touch screen tablet instantaneously.  All you have to do is fold the screen over and you immediately have a touchscreen tablet.\n\nThe device is incredibly easy to use, and easy to set up.  If you have a google account set up will link you to all your files within a couple of minutes through the easy set up.  From there you are able to access all your files via the internet quickly.  The great thing about this laptop is that it also has USB and HDMI ports so that you can bring files with you, or connect it to other devices.  I love this feature as well, because many tablets do not give you the ability to connect via a USB or HDMI port.\n\nThis product is quickly replacing my old laptop because of its size and portability.  The speed is also fantastic on this device, and it allows you to surf, and work lightning fast.  The days of lugging around my oversized laptop are over.  The screen on the device is crystal clear (you can read all about the capabilities online with all the technical details).  For light work, and for portability I really like this chromebook.

From more hardened metal fans, to females, to people just getting into the rock genre, their style of music is open enough and friendly enough to the ears that almost anyone can get into their music.  With each passing album, the band has tended to lean more towards a softer, more alternative sound than their previous releases.\n\nAs the band has matured, so as their sound.  \"Life Starts Now\" embraces a much softer side to Three Days Grace, while still managing to bring out some great hard rock songs from time to time as well.  The album gets things started with \"Bitter Taste\".  The track contains a great hook and melody that may have listeners singing along and tapping their feet to the rhythm and lyrics in no time.  Whereas this track embodies the feelings one may have during a tough breakup, the following track \"Break\" leans in the opposite direction.  \"Break\" is a great song with a pretty positive message about making the best out of what you have and taking advantage of every situation you get.\n\nFrom here, the songs continue to echo the same types of feelings, and the toe tapping resumes throughout the album's play-length.  Even the slower songs, such as \"World So Cold\" and \"Someone Who Cares\" have enough melody and rhythm going on that it's sure to entrap the listener and have them singing the tracks long after the album is over.\n\nStand out tracks include: \"Someone Who Cares\" and \"Last to Know\" due to the fact that they stray so much from the remainder of the album's formula.  Following a much slower, soothing sound in both instances, each of these two tracks is unique and worth listening to multiple times.  At first, the departure of sound may be a turn off to some for these two tracks, but after several playbacks, the style stands out from the rest of the songs found on \"Life Starts Now\".\n\nThe majority of the album tends to lean towards the subject matters of love and the loss of love.  Tracks like \"Bitter Taste\", \"Last to Know\" and \"Someone Who Cares\" talk about love and how losing love or trying to regain it can be a difficult task.  Other songs such as \"Break\" and \"Life Starts Now\" tend to have much \"peppier\" tempos and subject matters when compared to the majority of the tracks on the album.\n\nOverall, however, the album is a great listen from start to finish.  Whether you're looking for a new alternative album to add to your collection, or are just getting into the genre, Three Days Grace's \"Life Starts Now\" is a great album to purchase.  The catchy hooks, strong, emotional lyrics, and overall feeling of the album is bound to stick with the listener each time the album is played.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "212025", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

He didn't express himself in math, he made sweeping generalizations about society (not always backed by strong evidence), and he freely drew on the insights of history, sociology, and politics, paying little heed to interdisciplinary boundaries.  For that reason, many economists looked down their noses at him.  And for that reason, his books are still in print and enjoyed by readers decades after they first appeared.  Galbraith was more than an economist.  He was a great social critic, a great debunker of cant, and a superb prose stylist.  He was the Veblen of post-World War II America.\n\nHe was at the top of his powers when he wrote \"The New Industrial State\" in the 1960s.  The book came as close as anything did to summarizing the Galbraithian \"system.\"  Parts of it are outdated, such as the assertion that financial markets have little influence on big corporations, or the strained argument that the American and Soviet economic systems were \"converging.\"  Other parts, however, are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago, such as the critique of advertising and consumerism, or the analysis of how our gigantic defense industry shapes policy and influences the Pentagon.  In a time when the Federal Reserve is bailing out banks and scrambling to protect the economy from the miscalculations of the financial sector, it's good to be reminded that the private sector looks to government to keep the economy on a even keel, no matter what the official ideology of the private sector may be.\n\nMost of all, \"The New Industrial State\" displayed Galbraith's genius for stepping back and asking big questions.  These continue to haunt economics, even though textbook writers bury them in footnotes.  Why DO we treat GDP is an adequate measure of social welfare?  Why DO we choose to consume higher productivity in the form of goods rather than leisure?  Why DOES our pedagogy emphasize \"perfect competition\" when the economy is dominated by big firms?  Why DO we assume that workers and managers are motivated solely by pecuniary considerations?  And on and on.\n\n\"The New Industrial State\" is a trove of intellectual riches, expressed in masterful and witty prose.  Every undergraduate economics student should read it.  So should every educated citizen.  It's a 20th century classic.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "212027", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Although the relationship she forms with Sam may ultimately have been good for her, showing her that she had internal strength she would never have guessed out.  It makes for a very powerful story.\n\nI think the most interesting part of this book was Janice's honesty about her negative feelings toward Sam.  To be able to say that you're angry at a person in Sam's position takes a lot of strength.  The same to admit that you have doubts about  the truth of what someone you care about says to you.\n\nAnd this is a memoir that is easy to read.

If a lot of these songs are of lesser material, this is nothing new for Streisand, since her choice of material has always been eclectic, even in her early recording days, and perhaps a reminder of the attitude of her mentor Barry Dennen, who was more interested in the singer drawing attention to herself rather than subjugating to the song. (This argument was sweetly defended by saying she was \"acting\" the songs). Examples of this mentality here are One More Night and Deep in the Night, where the greatest pleasure is in hearing her histrionic climbs. Honey, Can I Put on Your Clothes, prefigures Barbra's transvestite interest in Yentl, though it's telling that she got the greenlight for Yentl at the cost of Peters.

Oh my words this story was sexy! I completely fell in love with not just the main characters but all the characters. Every single person that was described or that had a voice was intricately woven and needed to make this story one thatll be a long lasting favorite.\n\nDo you believe in fate? Do you believe that there is one person for everyone and one moment that will define who you're supposed to be connected too; who grounds you? For Lake Jones, she met her person at the worst possible timing in the world. Cage Monaghan, the nations star, was it for Lake. They shared one moment in a series of moments only to have life keep them separate.\n\nFast forward years later, Cage fumbles back into Lakes life. Let me say now that I love me some Cage!! He is that guy! That guy whos perfect yet flawed at the same time. You will fall in love with him, hook line and sinker!! The way he loves Lake, oh my, and the teasing he dishes out, so funny!\n\nFunny? I cant even count the many times that I laughed out loud while reading! There were a few times that I went running to my husband to share with him the one liners that just kept me in a fit of giggles.\n\nThrough all the good times while reading I was also brought into some very real struggles these characters had that not only made me hyper aware but also made me sit in awe of the inspiring strength that lay hidden within the words. Once I started reading, I didn't stop. I needed to just be in this world that took me away from reality and I couldn't be happier with my time spent with these characters. The writing was great, the flow was perfect and the conflicts were as real as I sit here writing.  The passion these characters go through to overcome what society deems to label and say whats appropriate in life was awesome to read unfold.\n\nIf you love second chance romances, or if you love stories with a sports theme, One is for you. If you like to have a sexy story that also makes you laugh, One is that book for you. If you love to have your heart beating so fast you don't know how long youve been lost in all the feelings, start reading now. If you love to be surprised at each turn of the page, you will not be disappointed at any one time while reading this beauty!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "212047", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Goodness, this is my first time reading Alexander's work, but I sensed something SOOOOOO special about this story I couldn't pass it up.....indeed, EVERY part of this book was wonderfully written and tangibly enjoyed from the FIRST page!  I am NOT a fan of pink, but I couldn't stop looking at that BEAUTIFUL cover while reading and the story never failed to keep my attention through almost 500 pages.  It was such an amazing read that I even forgot to take notes!  Yes, this book is FILLED with excellent food and dishes, but mostly it appeals to the reader's heart through Eleanor and the amazing character she is.\n\nThe book begins with Eleanor being a volunteer for the wounded during war in 1864 and this entire scene resonates with her in such a way that she remembers it throughout the story.  She even makes a promise to one dying soldier and she doesn't give up the unlikelihood of fulfilling this promise no matter how many years it takes to do so.\n\nEleanor must move in with her aunt later in the story after leaving her father and his ailing mind in an asylum; the scene is powerfully written and my heart ached EXACTLY as Eleanor did in leaving her precious Papa to the hands of the capable medical staff.  My heart broke even as I read that part.\n\nI do have to say regarding Aunt Adelicia that I was surprised at how welcoming her aunt is when Eleanor moves in.  I really thought the aunt would be cordial, cold, and distant, but she is quite the opposite.  Even with her own agenda to guide Eleanor with, this aunt really felt like a surrogate mom in so many ways.  I didn't always agree with her methods/intentions, but I respected their relationship and believed that Adelicia was truly determined to see Eleanor entrusted in a solid arrangement.  Though she was not my favorite character in the story, she did keep the plot interesting.\n\nI have no interest in Botany or plant life, but I was taken in with Marcus's passion towards flowers and his brilliant ways of creating the perfect specimens.  I didn't agree with keeping his secrets so tightly hidden, but I did understand his reasons.  More than once he had my sympathies and I had no trouble falling for his character as the man for Eleanor.  He really was Mr. Darcy to Eleanor's Elizabeth! (I found Eleanor very similar to Elizabeth Bennett, especially in how she enjoyed walking so much)  He understood everything about her heart and endeavored to give her whatever her heart desired, it became his mission throughout to make her smile.\n\nMy heart melted over and over again at Eleanor's cooking for the widows and the children.  Oh my, this book is so utterly touching and honoring to fallen soldiers.  With the incredible descriptions, the reader feels like you're THERE with these beautiful souls that Eleanor comes to love as her own family.  Mr. Stover, Naomi and Caleb, Mr. Fitch (wow to those donuts), and even Nurse Smith who takes care of Theodore.....I was amazed by the resilience of this community as they blessed Eleanor and made her dreams come true in a TOTALLY different way than she expected!\n\nWithout a doubt, Eleanor was my hero through and through!  She is compassionate, diligent, fiercely independent, giving, has an amazing heart that would rival ANY royal, faithful, trustworthy, has an adorable sense of humor, utterly intelligent, hardworking, passionate for people and cooking, and always determined to do the right thing.  I never ONCE saw her as plain or unappealing, she is so very tall and completely unconventional as a Southern woman, but that only made her MORE appealing and special!  Seeing the world through her eyes in this novel moved me more than once and touched me more than I would've thought possible for a fictional character.  This is my first read by Alexander, but I'm convinced it won't be my last.  I highly recommend this book even if historical fiction is not your typical genre, it will definitely win you over and leave you smiling.  Every single part of the plot was addressed, each character got their individual conclusions, and the ending to this story leaves you feeling warm all over.  I'm thrilled I got the chance to review this and I'm grateful for the love found in these pages.  *also included are discussion questions and a note from the author describing historical facts in the book*\n\nI want to thank the author and Bethany House Publishers for the review copy provided.

It's sort of a collection of essays about bad clowns.\n\nRadford starts off with a bit of history, and he puts together in the clown category some aspects I would not have thought of, but that make sense. The Punch and Judy puppet shows of course feature Punch's gratuitous violence to all and sundry, but I would not have seen a connection with the figure of Harlequin in commedia del'arte or the ancient business of kings having fools and jesters who can get away with criticism by dint of their defined role. Then there's the British clown Joseph Grimaldi (1778-1837) whose troubled life apparently is reflected in his memoirs, edited by one Charles Dickens, and Dickens seems to have much to do with the development of the bad clown trope (I must have missed those novels).\n\nOther chapters address many related topics. Chapter 4 discusses irrational fear of clowns. Chapter 5 examines bad clowns in ink, largely comics. I had never heard of comics specializing in bad clowns and evil clown characters. Based on Radford's reporting, I'd say it is an acquired taste. Chapter 6 looks at \"bad clowns of the screen\" including film but also television (and now one assumes in social media), including The Simpsons. Chapter 7 discusses bad clowns in music--apparently bad clowns show up in contemporary music of the sort older adults like me are blissfully unaware of. Chapter 8 discusses clown porn--discusses, with no examples or illustrations, thankfully.\n\nChapter 9 covers creepy clowns and killer clowns, including some real killers. Chapter 10 covers activist clowns, clowns who use their humr and techniques for partisan views, which must hearken back to court jesters. Chapter 11 covers dip clowns, persons in clown costume suspended above a water tank; these insult passersby to the point they buy several baseball tosses to dunk the clown. Chapter 12 which is brief, looks at phantom clowns. These seem to be a few furtive individuals lurking in some form of clown costume and just plain phantoms existing in the minds and perceptions of people.

I installed it on a barely two month old Toshiba laptop  (Intel Core 2 Duo 2.80 GHz, 6 GB RAM, Vista Home Premium, 64 bit) which up until then, was running like a dream.  Trend Micro first had me uninstall my previous AV software (AVG Free) and Spybot Search and Destroy which I did.  I closed all open applications and ran the installation disk.  But even at that, things did not go smoothly.  After the installation was complete the first thing I tried was to access the UI but clicking on the icon in the system tray elicited no response; right click, left click, it didn't matter, nothing happened.  While I was considering my options, I noticed that the firewall was turned off.  Since I couldn't get into the interface, and trying to turn it on via the control panel was unsuccessful, I re-booted the computer hoping that would make things right.  Nope.  A second re-boot produced the same results.\n\nI'm pretty stubborn and I really wanted to try out the features in this software but one thing convinced me that perhaps it just wasn't for me.  My system, previously so fast and responsive was behaving as if someone had poured molasses into the processor.  It was sluggish in the extreme and even the simple process of opening a browser window took eons.  It was at that point that I decided to uninstall the program.\n\nI don't know if the problems I had with Trend Micro resulted from Vista, as some have suggested (doubtful since many other Vista users have reported success) or whether they're caused by a conflict with some of the other programs I'm running.  I do know that although Trend Micro has worked very well for others, it just does not agree with my system.\n\nI hesitated over the star rating to give this product since I wasn't able to evaluate it fairly.  I would have preferred to omit the rating entirely but since that isn't an option, I'm giving it two stars which I hope reflects both its incompatibility with my computer and the success that others have reported in using the program.\nScore:"}], "output": "2 \n", "formatted_output": "2", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "212079", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Lately she has been inquiring about his personal life. The Queen's successor, Alex is married to an American and the people of their country disapprove of the union. Loch is fifth in line to the throne, but due to circumstances such as age and choice of spouses regarding the other candidates, it puts him front and center. But as soon as that is brought up, he is told it would be best if he left the country. That way things can simmer down and Alex can take her rightful place when the time comes. Taylor is a computer genius. She's great with computers, she should be she's on line most of her life. She is asked by a friend to be Loch's guide while he is in New York. Loch quickly realizes Taylor has many male admirers. Even with them being polar opposites, Loch understands why. Taylor is sweet, funny and gorgeous, and she's just the distraction he needs. And distract one another, they definitely do. Taylor's life is complicated. Between work and the gaming community, she has a fellow gamer with an unhealthy obsession stalking her, whom has also become a stage 5 clinger. Loch finds himself pursuing Taylor. He has never pursued a woman before, but Taylor is different and right now different feels right to him. Loch doesn't want to be chosen as the new King, so he devises a plan to keep himself off the throne. Taylor seems to be falling hard for him. Is Loch having similar feelings, or is it just wishful thinking on her part? It doesn't really matter. Loch is used to getting what he wants...damn the consequences. Only this time, kind, quirky and sexy Taylor may suffer said consequences......a broken heart.\nLoch needed an out and he found that in Taylor. Too bad he didn't realize that, not only did he deceive Taylor, he's been deceiving himself.\nI ABSOLUTELY LOVED, LOVED THIS BOOK ! ! !

Granted, there aren't many people who I play with online that also have headsets, and I don't play that many games that are team based or require much communication, but it's always nice to be able to do so in something like say, Borderlands 2. When I was offered a chance to get one of these RIG headsets, I figured now was the time to give it a shot. Given that this is the first one I've used, I can't say that it's the best out there, or worth its price. I -can- say that this sucker is comfortable, clear and makes for an enjoyable gaming experience, letting you hear all the game's audio while talking to your friends. As an added bonus, you can even listen to music on your phone or mp3 player with it with the right jack.\n\nIt may seem gimmicky to include a port for your phone, and I can safely assume that most people won't be using this feature. However, it's still nice to have in case you're waiting for an important call, or have a job position where people are calling you frequently. Both the mic that flips out of the headset, and the one that hangs from the cord are great and worked without any problems.\n\nIf I had something to compare this to, I'd give a more detailed review. Since it's my first item like this, it'll serve as the standard if I get another one. I haven't used it a whole lot for games since I don't play many multiplayer ones, given my work schedule, but for anyone who's looking for a quality headset that isn't going to break the bank, this would be an optimal choice.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "212083", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Four years past their previous studio effort \"God's equation\" the line up of singer Nils K. Rue, guitarist Jorn Viggo Lofstad, bassist Steinar Krokmo, drummer Stian Kristoffersen and keyboardist Ronny Tegner re-emerge under a somewhat new musical approach.\n\nOn \"Heavenly ecstasy\" the group takes a considerable musical turn towards melodic metal, suppressing the progressive element on most songs on the album. You can always expect instrumental twists and turns but for the biggest part the musical structures have been simplified making \"Heavenly ecstasy\" a catchier and perhaps more direct album. Possibly the change in artistic direction could be partly attributed to the change in record label; having left \"LMP\", the group signed with the renowned \"SPV\" which might also explain why it took this long for \"...Ecstasy\" to be released.\n\nIt has to be addressed that the band does retain its heaviness as the production qualities are similar to previous \"Pagan's mind\" albums. Having said that, on some songs the main passages come out so clean that, believe it or not, deliver an AOR-essence; such tunes are \"Intermission\", \"Follow your way\", \"Walk away in silence\" and \"Live your life like a dream\".\n\nIndeed \"Heavenly...\" is probably the catchiest \"Pagan's Mind\" album to date without completely disregarding their progressive nature. Overall \"Heavenly Ecstacy\" should appeal to long-term admirers of the band while possibly attracting fans of related bands such as \"Jorn\" and \"Firewind\".\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "212091", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Tricky to clean though, so i soak it first. I dropped it in the vehicle with good results. It will stay sealed from about a two foot drop to a seat, or  continued three foot total drop to floor.

For those who are looking for a teaching guide that includes printable worksheets or a variety of activities to teach the material, this set does not come with those materials.  The model for learning with this set revolves a lot around having the students working together to identify the issues with the sample writings, and with teachers reviewing the students free writing.  Overall, I found this set to be good for both homeschooling and classroom teaching environments, but found the material to be a bit too redundant in teaching style and a bit too structured.  With books this short in length and limited to the six books and fourteen 1-2 page magazine articles, I would imagine the kids would get bored quickly unless you supplement with other reading and teaching materials.  Overall, this is a good basis for teaching grammar, sentence structure, and writing, but I would definitely supplement with other resources as well to keep things interesting.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "212110", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It is similar to the \"Big Wheel\" that I had as a kid, and is a younger child version of a \"Green Machine\". It is mostly made of molded plastic parts, with metal axles and handle bars. It has an adjustable seat (moves forward and back) so that as your child grows and their legs get longer, you can simply pop the seat back out and place it in the next set of holes back. It can be adjusted three times, about 1.5 inches back each time.\n\nAssembly: Assembly was extremely straight-forward. In fact, my 13-year old son put it together with no problem. The instructions are easy to follow and it requires minimal tools (see photos). The tools we used were a small, adjustable wrench, a hammer, and a flat head screw driver. There weren't any particular tricky parts, but the hammer was useful to push in some of the pieces (such as the caps at the end of the rear axle). All the stickers are already applied, so no worries about DIY stickers that end up crooked or with air bubbles underneath. My son was able to put the entire tricycle together without me saying a word, so I would say the instructions were very well-written.\n\nOnce assembled, it worked great. Both boys and girls will enjoy this Big Flyer (apparently there is a pink version as well). As for age range, it will definitely depend on the size of your child. It was way too big for a young 2-year old, but by 3, some kids may have long enough legs to ride it (it is rated for 3+, but again, it will really depend on the size of your child, rather than age, in my opinion).\n\nOverall, this tricycle is a lot of fun for kids and is easy on the adults. I highly recommend it!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "212112", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

As a fan of a few of his other works (notably The Great Gatsby, This Side of Paradise and The Collected Short Stories), I went into this book with a healthy enthusiasm. . . What I discovered was a story that was painful to watch unfold and one that kept me engaged and interested in what was happening from the first page to the end.\n\nIt tells the tale of Dick Diver, his wife Nicole, and numerous other equally complicated individuals who sway in and out of their lives over the years following World War One and just prior to the rise of Adolph Hitler.  Americans living in or around Paris and the resort spots of France, these are rich people, people so rich that their money has literally destroyed them.  They have become those rare people who don't have to wish for anything physical, whether it comes in the dream of a mansion on a hill in some far away country, a group of friends that includes royalty and movie stars, or sexual conquests with anyone you can even momentarily desire.  All their dreams have, or could possibly on a whim, come true.  And so there is nothing in this life left for them . . .\n\nIt is a sad tale of likable people coming unglued, of seeing their lives destroyed and watching nobody care, regardless of their goodness.  It is a story of absolute and utter desolation, finally, as the almost journalistic ending comes at you.  It is like falling out of touch with someone who was once the most important person in your life, hearing vague stories about what they are up to and realizing they are getting fainter and fainter and fainter . . .\n\nThis was quite obviously a very personal book for its author, a disillusioned man who saw many of his own dreams come true early on and who was left to watch his own joy turn into boredom and finally complete indifference.  This book is the nightmare that all of us hope never comes true.  It is somewhat comforting, in the end, to realize that in spite of his own early death, his crazy wife and his alcoholism, F. Scott Fitzgerald's story isn't anywhere near as terrible as this one.\n\nIt is, among a multitude, one of the better books I have ever read.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "212116", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

There was NO odor, as is common with these mattresses (the odor is supposed to go away after a day or so).  The mattress took 5 hours to fully inflate to a tad more than the 10\" I expected.

Absolutely loveable MCs, with engaging plots and always sexual tension.\n\nThis book is no different; the MCs are adorable, though we already knew that about Cash, having seen him in Delicious and Falling, though briefly.  What is very different (besides being set in the Seattle area) is the serious tone of this book.  The others are much more light-hearted and fun.  While this one has SOME fun, the main conflicts in the plot are quite sobering.  Robbie was hurt badly in a car accident.  Robbie's 'best friend' Sarah nearly lost the ability to ever walk again and she did lose her dreams of becoming a professional dancer.  Cash has been bereft without Robbie, and it's gone on for 7 years!\n\nOnce again, I am giving major kudos to Sierra Riley for creating drama and angst but having it develop organically, from the events of the plot.  It would have been easy for her to separate Cash and Robbie and up the drama factor by having either character hide the truth from the other.  I really do not like that kind of angst in a book. (I mean, that kind of angst is their own fault!  It does nothing for me except want to tell the characters they are TSTL.)  We have Robbie being honest about why he does what he does, and then we have Cash being honest about the things that he does.

I admired her determination and hardworking attitude. I wasn't surprised when she made it into the Sharpshooters. I was surprised by a couple of things: 1) the lack of supervision for the Sharpshooters (even music groups at my university have more supervision than the Sharps), and 2) how much I enjoyed a story filled with boys. I'm usually all about the female-driven books, but I didn't mind that Jordan was pretty much the only girl on most of the pages. And I really enjoyed the group of friends that developed for Jordan, but I especially loved the romance with Isaac. I liked all of the dynamics with him, and he was super swoony. I enjoyed being able to contrast him with Jordan's ex, and he was so much better for her, partly because Isaac and Jordan got to form a friendship first.\nThe ending felt a little off to me; I think it was mainly the parts post-competition.

Rather than being made of hard plastic which often tends to crack under weight or if dropped, the exterior of the case is constructed of a well reinforced neoprene like material that can withstand pressure and falls without caving or breaking, so it offers excellent protection for the glass essential oil bottles inside it.\n\nThe inside of the carrier has strong elastic holders that hold each bottles securely and also prevents them from impacting the bottles on either side. Five bottles fit on each side, and there's a modestly padded nylon covered divider in the center that protects the bottles from up and down contact in the event that the case is dropped. Finally, the case has a zippered closure and the zipper functions smoothly.\n\nThe case measures approximately 7\" long by 3.5\" wide and weighs a mere 0.5oz when empty, so it doesn't take up much space or weight in your luggage. If planning to use bottles larger than 10ml be sure to measure them to make sure they aren't over 3.3\" high to be sure they'll fit into the case when zipped closed. I pushed down on this case with as much force as I could to see if the top would cave under pressure and it didn't, so I think it makes an excellent way to transport essential oils (or small bottles of medicines for that matter).\n\nThis essential oil case was provided at no cost by the manufacturer for evaluation and review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "212139", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Like Hemingway, Carver had the gift of creating a world through brief and beautiful glimpses. Never does he insert any clunky ideology or literary affectations.

The book is from 1988, and is a bit wordy, as is typical of romance from the '80s. Also typical of the '80s, the sex scenes are ripe with innuendo. The story is amazing, though.\n\nThe hero, a Native American, is a recovering alcoholic. The heroine admires him greatly, and the guy is just a great guy. He's incredibly humble. This story makes clear that battling alcoholism is \"one day at a time.\" The hero struggles. He's unsure of himself and his future. And, after experiencing probably the worst day of his life and after four years of sobriety, he drinks.\n\nI loved this hero. This guy is HUMBLE.\n\nAnd I loved the slow building of the couple's relationship. She's an engineer. She's building a road. He works for her and is her best worker. It takes them a long time to trust each other. To get to know each other. To take a chance with each other. Just lots to like here, and it overcomes the '80s effects.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "212144", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Now we get Zach's story as his life is interrupted by a kitten that escapes from the neighbor's kids. The mother is Jessie the receptionist at the vet clinic that we met in both of the previous books. She thinks Zach is a player, and Zach has no interest in a relationship so they have pretty much avoided one another before this. Once the cat get involved things get interesting especially as its antics are assisted by a dog that Zach is supposed to be fostering. I swear the two critters had meetings at night to plan all this stuff though it worked out great in the story. Once again Jenn has gone above and beyond in creating a romance novel that flows smoothly and highlights the fur babies at the same time. As much as I was looking forward to this book after the last two I was not disappointed. If you enjoy a good contemporary romance novel then you have to try this book.

The seating area is approximately 19\" off the ground and the arms are a bit under 25.5\" above the ground. There is a small side compartment that hangs on the right side that has a mesh pocket for small items and a can holder that has a drawstring to hold smaller water bottles. The arms are solid and not fabric so they will not sag when you put weight on them. The tubes that support the chair (legs of the chair) are thick and rigid. The only problem I see is that it is difficult to open and close since the chair is built so rigid. This is actually a good thing and most likely will get easier with use and movement. I had troubles closing and opening it due to the stiffness and it was a bit hard to get the chair fabric folded just right, but I actually see this as a positive. The fabric is a thicker material than those cheap chairs you find everywhere and the stitching and seams are good quality. The weight is a bit much and of course the size is large even when this is stuffed into the carrying case. It will not be great if you must carry this for long periods so keep this in mind. Overall the chair is built nicely, large enough for most adults, solid and of good quality.... it is large and a bit heavy and initially very stiff to open & close up.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "212149", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Given the enormous expectations gamers have expressed, it's easy to see why so man people have felt let down.  Expectation is the precursor to disappointment, sadly.  In that light, take these one and two star reviews with a grain of salt.  No, it's not perfect, but no game is.\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion about graphics.  To my eyes it's a gorgeous game, especially on the ps4.  It doesn't top InFamous Second Son, but it's still a beautiful rendition of Chicago.  A lot of the game mechanics appear to be borrowed from Ubisoft's stable of games:  hacking from Deus Ex, the cover system from Splinter Cell, etc., but they've all been integrated rather nicely.  I found the controls largely fluid, at least while on foot and during gun play. The voice acting was solid, the soundtrack acceptable, and there's simply a ton of stuff to do. 10 hours in and I haven't even completed a Act 1.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of mis-steps in my estimation.  Yes, the driving is atrocious.  Prepare to fishtail...everywhere.  The lack of customization is surprising, whether it be clothing, cars, or anything else.  I noticed little things, like the time not showing on your smart phone/profiler, which struck me as odd.  I had some major frame rate drops during the intro mission, too.  The missions can be very challenging, so prepare to die and fail a lot.\n\nThere's a great sense of paranoia running through Watch_Dogs, especially when other players can hack your game.  We live in a world where virtually no one appears to have any right to privacy:  the NSA, spying, hacking, data centers (I drive past the Bluffdale, UT data center everyday), wi-fi everywhere. There's no way to protect yourself.  Someone's always just a click away from digitally intruding on our lives.  In that regard, Watch_Dogs has plenty to say about modern society and the big, wide gray areas we all inhabit.\n\nI've enjoyed this game a lot.  Give it a try.  Give in to the paranoia.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "212182", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I was in the market for a decent system with 5-disc system. After months of research, I have decided on this sytem - even though I couldn't find any reviews. You can get detailed specifications on Panasonic's Web site or elsewhere on the Internet.\n\nWhat I liked so far:\n1) FM/AM presetting can be automatic. However, living in a big city, it found so many radio stations that it ran out of all presets before even it got to my favorite stations. Manual setting is pretty easy.\n2) VCR rewinding is high-speed. I used to use a rewinder, but this one rewinds much too quickly.\n3) DVD quality and sound quality exceed my expectations - but that doesn't mean anything to you. I never liked my music/movies too loud anyway. System automatically sets subwoofer level at 4 (high) for DVD and at 2 for music CDs - which can be easily changed. We watched Incredibles at level 4, but volume at a decent level. Sounds from ending scenes were way too much realistic for us (and for our children).\n4) Remote is very functional and feels good. Some features need reading the manual.\n5) FM reception is very good.\n\nThings that I don't like:\n1) Doesn't play MP3 songs written to a DVD disc. My older (cheap) system used to do that. Big disappointment for me.\n2) Manual says that I could randomize between different audio CDs. I couldn't get it do that among MP3 disks. It might work on regular audio CDs, but I haven't tried that yet.\n3) Only one set of input jacks. I have HD receiver and a cable receiver. I have connected HD receiver right now and cable goes directly to TV. I am somewhat disappointed with that. Fortunately VCR is built-in. When you want external signal, sytem should be put in VCR mode with AV selected (described in the manual).\n4) Connecting wires to sub-woofer and speakers is difficult. Holes are very small and inserting a multi-strand wire in that hole was a big challenge for me. Wires that come with the system may work fine, but we have pre-wired surround sound in the room which has multi-strand wires.\n\nOther:\n1) Manual clearly says not to push the disk trays in (use the close button)\n2) Disk trays look and feel like delicate\n3) Cable that comes with the system can be used as component cables\n4) Manual could have been better\n5) Best Buy carries them - if you want to look at it\n\n**Updated on 7/3/2005 **\n1) It does randomize between different CDs. However, setting that up was a challenge for me.\n2) It does not play MPEG movies. BIG turn off for me.\n3) I have an extremely scratched DVD. All the other DVD players skip/freeze on that disc. But, this DVD player played it fine.\n4) Overall, still happy with the system.\n\n**Updated on 9/13/2005 **\nI recently encountered the same problem Donald (another reviewer) had experienced. DVD dialogue volume becomes very low or diminishes. However, MP3 music and CDs play fine. So, I called Panasonic. The lady _quickly_ told me to refer to page 41 of the manual and set the 'Center Focus.' I tried that with skepticism, but it worked. Now, the system is back to normal. My overall satisfaction is still high because I found some cool features as I am also finding problems like this. One such cool feature is the ability to search for a song in an MP3 CD of hundreds of songs.\n\n** Update: 9/29/2008\nDisplay at the front died (like it did to many other users), but I am continuing to use it. Yes, it is hard to use it without the display on the unit, but on-screen-display (OSD) on the TV helps to some extent. Replacing the unit is such a time consuming process that I am willing to put up with the inconvenience of no display.\n\n** Update: 6/24/2010\nThe DVD player quit working. It takes too long to read the disk and then displays the error message \"Check the Disk\". I have tried DVDs, MP3 CDs, music CDs, etc. and the problem persists. Customer help didn't even try to help - he just pointed me to the local service center. My next DVD player will not be a Panasonic.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.78}, {"id": "212190", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The unexplained idea that animals would band together and seek to destroy the human race seemed a little too far fetched for me.

I also couldn't understand how natural predators ganged up with their prey on the humans almost like an alliance between the predators and the more benign animals. It was really laughable when Joe gets bitten by a ferret and rather than \"brain\" it or pull it off, the author decides that Joe should take some tongs he has, heat them over a bunsen burner (all the while, this ferret has its teeth buried in Joe's leg) and then take the hot tongs and crush the ferret's head. It didn't make any sense to me as the book didn't either. Finally, while they are scavenging for supplies in the warehouse, Joe notices bleach (a flamable liquid) but notes it for future reference rather than getting it up to their barricaded enclosure for use as a defense against the animals. Hint: Joe anything flamable then can be used to start a fire and will work on animals as a defense. An author works hard on his novel, so I don't like to denigrate the work but this rather unexplained and simplistic story line required more than a simple suspension of disbelief, it required you to remove your brain completely.

I call that divine\npower, the ability to drap ones frame in security and elegance.\n\nThere are many wrestlings with the almighty dollar in Harrison's writing, maybe that's why I identify with it so much. Sometimes it comes so easily that its best just to give it all away and other times it barely comes at all so why save? There are big questions regarding what does it mean to give up safety and a future for a few moments of adulterated love, and why is it that when the cost is so high that always makes the treasure so much more alluring. If you can't afford a vacation, Harrison will take you there; albeit rather smarmily and with the very same regret you may have felt once enjoying a five thousand dollar vacation you look down to see that not only is your wallet gone, but there are a band of ne'er do wells on their way to see you. So lovely.\n\nBy far, The Man who Gave Up His Name is such a comical, legendary, and yes, romantic piece; and on conditional terms shall stave the heart. If one is willing to completely let themselves free fall into the orange and navy hued melting sunset narrative that literally bleeds of aching where the days grow lengthier yet simpler as the future approaches, much like a leisurely sea swell; all are ocean view.\n\nI first saw the movie \"Revenge,\" with Kevin Costner some years ago, and thought, \"well, that was pretty.\" - - obviously, the novella is like having a choice between real or fake. I own this book for one reason: Nordstrom. I have dreamt upon this very life change so many times, I dare say it's under option's 1,2, and 3 for things I would do if given the chance.\n\nSome women may look at these stories as sexist, and I would caution them to take a second look. Nordstrom, if his character is to be understood is a man whose heart lies within a deep ravine and few can get to it. Still, why punish a man for having sexual yearnings? Yes, there are other Jim Harrison novels where I would agree there is a dash of sexism, yet for Legends, I can make no such call. Certain characters have a crude way of looking at women, and who seem preoccupied with the female anatomy, B.D. comes to mind; however, this is inherent in his character and several other characters do not exhibit the same bawdliness. \"The Farmer's Daughter,\" which has just come out, displays an amazing sense of clarity and sensitivity toward the awfulness of Rape and the Post Traumatic Stress that follows. Sarah is a character that Harrison has drawn richely into a Montana framework and that story alone shows a compassion that very few writers attempt much less champion.\n\nMy advice is to plan on having a good time with this book; like a long sought after fishing trip. First, take off your watch, then forget the time, let your boat drift as she may, and just read.\n\nHaving a few moments with an American Master is a luxury many can afford within these troubled times, yet some forget the opportunity for grand transcending.

Listing sizes by year only gets you so far, because there are wide variations in faces and head sizes for kids of the same age. U.S. Divers lists this mask as 6+ years, but they also have a color-coded sizing system that works as follows:\n-Purple >> XS Faces to SM Faces\n-Red (this mask) >> Middle of XS Faces all the way to lower end of LG Faces\n-Blue >> SM faces to XL Faces\n-Gray >> MD Faces to XL Faces\nI don't understand why this sizing information is on the packaging but not on the product webpage. This mask fits a wide variety of faces (in a pinch, I could use it) but I would be hesitant to purchase it for a 6-7 year old unless they have a larger or rounder head than most kids. I think the sweet spot for this mask is probably 9 to 12 years old, but your mileage WILL vary.\n\nAs for quality, the mask and snorkel work fine. I'm not impressed with the frame of the mask; the arms that connect the buckle to the glass frame are thin (clearly visible in the product photos). The pin for the buckle is of a small diameter (perhaps 3/16\"). Overall, the quality is better than some cheap sets I've seen at sporting goods stores, but not as good as what you would find at a scuba shop (e.g. a Scubamax Dolphin). This is a blister pack product. Still, I think it does the job for snorkeling and if you get a good fit, well that's 90% of the challenge.\n\nAlso, it is customary with dive masks to clean off the inside of the glass with toothpaste in order to remove any film left over from manufacturing.

That's not to say the the romance isn't an enjoyable one - Bullock and Pullman are a very winning couple - with a nice payoff that ties several motifs neatly together.

I own about 12 versions of the novel on DVD, and this one is the best by far.  It's the closest to Shelley's original novel; the few additions made don't detract from the spirit of the novel and don't distort (as Branagh's version does) her themes or characterizations.  What I love most about is that the creature is quite young and, while still horrifying, not so monstrous as to make us forget that Victor intended to create a beautiful being (i.e., you can see the potential handsomeness despite his sickly hue and a few visible scars).  His youth makes it easier to understand that the creature is initially an infant, despite his stature--one abandoned by his \"father\" and left to learn from the random persons and experiences he comes across.  All this makes it easier to empathize with him and to ask the question: Was it his inate nature or the lack of nurture that made him into a \"monster\"?  My only real quibble is that while Donald Sutherland gives a fine performance, the difference between his and Walton's age and Victor's takes away from the doubling Shelley intended.\n\nOK, a lot of this review sounds pretty academic.

The box is the SAME size as last year, the set contains 32 LESS pieces as last year, yet it costs $10 MORE than last year.  A very poor combination without a doubt (especially given that last year's Star Wars Advent Calendar didn't sell very well and was available on clearance just about everywhere after the holidays).  But, in spite of that I couldn't risk not having a copy of what is otherwise a very cool Lego set in my collection.  I had a blast opening mine last year, and am looking very forward to opening this one this year.\n\nNext I'm going to list the set contents, so please skip the next two paragraphs if you want to be surprised.  But, since most of this info is available in the Amazon photos or easily obtainable online, I thought I'd also provide it hear for those who are interested.  Note, I purposefully list everything in alphabetical (and not chronological) order so as not to spoil the surprise too much. Not to mention the fact that I'm waiting to open mine and don't even know the order of appearance myself at this point.\n\nDepending on how/what you count, the set includes nine mini figures.  The obvious appeal of this new set are the two exclusive Santa Darth Maul and Snowman R2-D2 figures.  On top of that you also get Gungan Warrior, Hoth Rebel Trooper, Imperial Officer (Hoth), Rebel Trooper, Snowtrooper, Security Battle Droid, and Super Battle Droid.\n\nOther surprises include: AT-AT Walker, Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator, General Grievous' Starfighter, Gonk Power Droid (may also count as a mini figure to some), Gungan Shield Set, Gungan Submarine, Guns and Lightsaber, MTT, Naboo Flash Speeder, Naboo Royal Cruiser, Naboo Starfighter, P-Tower Turret, Separatist Shuttle/The Lapiz Cutter, Super Star Destoyer, and Vulture Droid.\n\nSo, there seems to be a bit more of a focus on the prequel this year, but still a sufficient amount of original trilogy stuff to keep just about everyone happy. And, while a few of the models leave a little to be desired, I also impressed at how well Lego is able to make a good representation of many of these items with so few pieces.\n\nI agree that $49.99 is a very expensive price tag for this set (it make so little sense it almost seems like it could be a mistake). And, I hope for everyone's sake that it comes down before they run out (preferably before the holidays, but even after would be fine if everyone who wants one is able to get one).

I recall some people complained of long download times. Please make sure that the Ethernet settings are appropriate for your home network, as the default connection speed is only 56k. I have mine set to 768k (sounds right) and the downloading process took only 20 minutes, approximately.\n\n*cracks a can of Red Bull*\n\nahh, where was I...\n\nOh yes. To connect to your home network router, first connect a suitable ethernet (cat5) cable to the A35 and the router. For me, the router is two rooms away and I didn't want to be bothered with going out and buying a wireless modem for the dvd player before I know it will be worthwhile, so I retrieved my 75 foot long cat5 cable and ran it from the router to the player up above the TV. This was necessary, as I do not have an appropriate video-in on the computers to view the setup screens. I realize not just anyone has a 50+ foot long cat5 cable laying around, so you will need to do the needful so that you can be connected to your router and have access to a television.\n\nNow, power up the A35 and go into Ethernet. The user's guide is very clear on how to do this, and worked for me just fine. Set DCHP to on and DNS to on (DNS is obtained via DCHP). Press confirm and wait a few seconds. If your IP address changes to one that seems correct (such as 192.168.1.102 or similar), then press OK to accept the changes. It is OK if your gateway is 0.0.0.0, at least it was for me.\n\nPower off the machine. Wait a few seconds. Power it back on.\n\nNow choose General->Maintenance->Update and run through the OK screens (license agreement or w/e that is). The player should now see the update server and will display a message that it is updating and to not power it off. Sound advice.\n\nWith a decent cable connection, you should be done in half an hour. The player will power itself off when the update is complete.\n\nTurn it back on. Do not worry about setting the time (again). There is a setting in the menu to have the player obtain time/date settings automatically via the network. Since turning that feature on, it has stopped nagging me with the set date screen on boot up.\n\nUnfortunately, I am still waiting on my Samsung LNT4069FX to arrive, so I cannot comment yet on upscaling. However, I just put in my widescreen version of Conan The Barbarian (a never-endingly great classic) and it works and looks just fine.\n\nBoot time is about 30-35 seconds, well within reason. You're only going to notice it if you forget to power on the player until the last moment. Make sure it's the first thing you do before pulling the film, grabbing drinks, getting comfy, etc.\n\nThe remote seems well-made and is very functional. There is a dedicated slow-motion button that shifts between 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8th speed frame rates. There is also a dedicated frame-forward button when paused. It has a very robust repeat system, which can repeat All, Title, Chapter, or point A-B.\n\nThe inclusion of TV controls (channel, vol, source, mute, power) on the remote is very nice and putting in the code is a cinch with a dedicated TV CODE button.\n\nThe user guide is very clear and informative, although I do not see anything regarding the persistent storage (128MB). It seems to be used for storing content downloaded from the internet that pertains to your movies, or for future feature upgrades to the player itself (from the A2 product description).\n\nAllegedly, the resume function only works on standard DVD and only if you keep the disc in the player. It clears the memory if you open the tray. Since all the HD-DVDs I have are going to be used as presents, I'm hesitant to open one for testing. I will take their word for it, though, as I've seen other users complain of resume not working.\n\nI wish the USB port was functional already for playing images or video (divx, h. 264), but that's a minor point, as I'm going to be connecting one of our computers to the LCD tv when it arrives via an extended S-VGA patch cable.\n\nOverall, this thing seems to be working fine. I will give an update once the Samsung arrives and I have had a chance to test it out.\n\n<rant>\nOh, and don't support Sony's proprietary Blu-ray format - they are already controlling too much of the entertainment industry as it is. The PS3 is a trojan horse attempt to establish a blu-ray infrastructure so that everyone who owns one will be coerced into buying Sony blu-ray discs by default. Very, very clever marketing strategy. I like Sony, but I don't approve of the way they are trying to manipulate and control all sides of the industry, from production, to the disc format, to the players themselves. They are going for it all, perhaps, partially as vengeance for their failed BETAMAX format. I like the idea of the hard coating (not the extremely thin layer of plastic), but I just don't think it's a good idea letting Sony rule all aspects of the film/entertainment industry, a monopoly in their own right. HD-DVD, with more layers, has a potential of around 140GB, which is more than enough for anything in the near future. Also, there is the new holographic technology coming out.

It goes on and on.  The novel was written when the belief of agnosticism was in the early  stages of being in 'vogue.' Also interesting, Darwin's Origin of the  Species had been published for some time, and the theory had rooted itself  in many areas of society.\nThis was not the traditional Victorian  novel that was written in the old English 'bonne bouche' manner on par with  Jane Eyre or Emma. The prose of the novel has a broken up fluidity to it;  it is not grandiloquent; it is in fact, quite brutal, edgy. As Elaine  Showalter writes in the excellent introduction to the Bantam Classic  edition, \"Readers expecting the structured plot of a typical  three-volume Victorian novel were startled by the oddity of African Farm,  with its poetic, allegorical, and distinct passages, and its defiance of  narrative and sexual conventions.\" With that clearly explained, it is  not a surprise that it shocked old, priggish Englanders with their stiff  upper lips and staunch, conservative manners, nor is it shocking that the  Church of England called the novel \"blasphemous.\"\nAfrican  Farm details the lives of three key characters: Waldo, Em and Lyndall. The  latter character is the one who seems to bring up the key issues that made  the novel controversal. Lyndall is always described as 'little,'  'delicate,' 'like a doll,' 'a flower.' However, she is the one who refuses  to marry (with one minor exception to the rule) until a social equilibrium  is established between men and women. She desires equality between the  sexes, and is willing to suffer for it. And she does, more than what is  expected. Odd as it may seem, but considering the period in which the novel  was written, the character of Lyndall really had to be physically  'feminized' in order to make up for her strongly held convictions of being  a 'total' woman and not 'half' a woman.\nIf any person reads the novel,  the character of Lyndall needs (from my view) special attention, for she  questions the values of men, women who accepted the standard, religion and  the social hierarchy in which she was born. Her questions seem like  cartels, challenges. Why can't she have a job? Why can't she be educated or  independent without the stigma 'weirdo' unflinchingly attached to her? Why  must she be dubbed 'strange?' The reader must always ask why when reading  this book. The three characters, Lyndall especially, endure a lot of  hardship, a hardship that mirrored the very author's life, i.e. her cold  and distant upbringing, the religious retraints placed on her life as well  as the life-clenching grasp that old norms had on women of that period.  African Farm was Olive Schreiner's liberty, her freedom from the societal  choke hold.\nIn conclusion, the novel is not one of grace and  patrician dogma. It is not a book of nice ladies and gentlemen sitting  under the African sun near exotic, wild flowers sipping tea and  participating in intellectual banter. No, it is an underscored work of  literature where ideas of human aspiration and ecumenical desires are  explored under a blazing sun and burnt, sandy plain.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "212229", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

These little earbuds are obviously not made to last.\n\nAfter just a few months of use, the ear buds are broken. The volume up button no longer activates so you can not adjust the volume. Unfortunately I figured this out after trying to adjust the volume and turning it down more than 1/2 way. Now I can't get the volume back up and they are pretty much useless. This is disappointing because I really liked the item but I thought they would have survived more than 20-25 uses. Good design but poorly made.\n\nThere is a lot to love about these little buds. The fit in the ear is superior to any other buds, wired or wireless, that I have owned. They sit comfortably yet firmly in the ear. These are great for running or cycling. They stay in place and wick away sweat well. They are also easy to pop out with a little handle on the top of the bud. The sound quality is really good. It is not quite as good as some of the high dollar wired buds I have but they are close. There is a good amount of bass and the range of sound is very good. The sound clarity is excellent. I would say that the buds could have slightly better range. When cycling, the signal would occasionally stutter but as you get going the Bluetooth seems to sync a little better and you get pretty consistent sound. The microphone works well and shields noise from wind nicely. I have taken calls on my bike and people on the other end have been able to hear me clearly. The buttons on the bud are well thought out and you can easily find them while running. These charge off of a standard micro USB...so compatibility is great.\n\nIf I had one complaint about the ear buds it would be battery life. They claim that you can get 6 hours of consistent use out of them. I have not had that experience. I would say I can get maybe 3-4 hours at most out of them without a charge. That is fine most of the time, but on those century cycling trips or long flights I wish they held a little more juice. I bought two sets of these, one for my wife and she has not had the battery complaint I have so maybe I got a pair with a less effective battery. Regardless, given everything else these are a great little set of wireless buds and I would definitely buy them again.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "212232", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

It requires two AAA batteries and the lock for the battery lid can be a bit tricky.  It opens easily but at first it can be a little difficult to close and can require more force than with similarly shaped electronic devices, such as a remote control, but not so difficult as to be a real obstacle.\n\nOnce set up, it's fairly intuitive, one button is for choosing the correct mode, such as car, house or star (each mode is arbitrary and interchangable), then the other button is for starting the journey.  Once you've pressed the start button, then you want to shut it off to save the battery life, and whenever you've reached your destination, you turn the device on, and voila, it'll automatically point you back in the right direction from which you came, plus it will tell you how far you have traveled.  When you first turn it on, however, you have to wait for the satellite dish symbol to stop blinking, which means that it has found its GPS coordinates, and depending upon where you're at, this time can vary in length.  Staying outside of buildings will give you a faster response.\n\nIt also has a compass that's easy to navigate and it allows for a reset in case you feel it's off kilter.  To reset the compass you simply turn it on then move it several times in a horizontal, figure 8 shape, and that's it.  Beyond that it's a rather straight forward, utilitarian compass, although one disappointing feature is that it doesn't give each direction such as north, south, east and west, it simply has an arrow that points north, and it also gives you the compass degrees.  For the novice, it would have been nice to have all 4 directions indicated since not everyone knows that a compass always points north.\n\nAnother cool feature is that it has an automatic shut-off setting of a few minutes to preserve the battery life, and it won't accidentally turn on since you have to hold the power button down for a few seconds to turn it on.\n\nIt's ruggedly built so it'll withstand bumps and falls, and looks like maybe even water but this I don't dare test nor is it mentioned in the instructions.\n\nThe only major downside I've found is that if you're surrounded by concrete structures or thick walls deep down in a building's basement, the GPS locator does not work, something to keep in mind when you're using this.  I suppose this might be considered a given or common sense if you will, but again, not everyone knows how these devices work so just an fyi for the potential buyers out there.\n\nOverall, a handy little tool for your average city trip, Sunday drive or sightseeing, but I wouldn't recommend it for the hardcore adventurers.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "212234", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Bane, bad guy turned respectable hero, meets Ms. Lydia Pallas, an obsessive compulsive young woman who has a successful career as a translator and analyst in the Boston Naval Yard in the late 1800s.\n\nLydia strives to maintain the perfect world she has created for herself since coming of age after a rather rough start in life. She is a bright, educated woman very forward thinking for the time period. She presents herself as an interesting, multi-layered woman who interacts very engagingly with the charming mysterious Bane.\n\nThe story delves into the opium trade during this time period and the lengths that people went to in order to maintain the very lucrative business of shipping and distributing opium. The historical element is interesting and detailed throughout the story.\nThe plot engaged my interest and I really wanted to keep reading. The romance between Bane and Lydia is secondary to the main story, which carries messages of faith and forgiveness. It is not often that you find a hero that has been a drug dealer in another life and a heroine, who struggles with opium addiction. Very interesting concept!\n\nI would definitely recommend this book to readers of historical fiction and inspirational fiction.

I can't say enough about how great this product has been for us. We bought it for our child to watch during teeth brushing, or to give us time to clean the kitchen etc. I know DVD's are sort of passe now but this thing has been awesome. It has been dropped, drooled on, poked, hit, smashed, dragged, and generally mistreated by a two through 4 year old and has survived it all. We took it on a trip to Europe with us so that it would occupy our son during the flight and it was a godsend. This unit has great battery life, you can get through at least a whole full length movie and a half. I think I got all the way through one of the Lord of the Rings movies and was pretty impressed. The screen is clear and holds up well. We have had to clean it so many times I was worried it was going to get scratched but it never has. The players internal battery charges extremely quickly. The only thing that's a bit difficult is navigating startup screens on some movies using the radial selection wheel but other than that, no issues. It also works for viewing JPEGs and MP3's. If you need a tough portable DVD player that will take a beating this is it. It recently developed an issue that at one particular angle the screen pixelates a bit because I think the connections are starting to wear down. It's easily fixed by moving the screen a bit. After 5 years of abuse I'm not surprised by this tiny issue.\n\nI try to make my reviews useful.

So far, it works perfectly.\n\nI've purchased a number of Lightning cables over the last year or so, and this is definitely one of the better ones.\n\nThe OEM Apple cables are... OK.  Had one that lasted a few months before it shorted out.  Luckily, they replaced it at the Apple Store with no problems.  But... it's short and prone to shorting out near the Lightning end when the cable kinks in that location, which seems to be common.\n\nI've had a number of different Monoprice cables.  These are pretty good cables, but again I've found varying quality levels.  Their 6-foot cable, with it's lifetime warranty, seems good, and when it works, it's great.  Unfortunately, this cable too seems prone to shorting out near the Lightning end, plus the cable is rather heavy and inflexible.  I'm on my 2nd RMA with that cable, but their service has been great.  I also have a 3-foot cable from them with a flat cable and metal ends.  Great cable, but it's only 3 feet long.\n\nI needed another for my wife, and given our cable history, wanted to find one with a Lifetime warranty.  This Luxtr fits the bill, so it's what we ordered.  So far, we're quite happy.  She can plug her iPhone in while lounging in bed, and the 6' cord lets her move around, stay plugged in, and so far, charging just fine.  Time will tell whether it lasts, but the lifetime warranty makes us feel good.\n\nAbsolutely no compatibility issues with my wife's iPhone 5S or my iPhone 6.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "212293", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Amazon price was half of my local home center price. I don't know if its my imagination or what, but the room temperature seems more steady. It could very well be, our old digital thermostat was 25 years old. While I found installation easy and straight forward, I would say this is not a project for the the average do-it-yourselfer, especially if you have heat+AC wiring and are electrically challenged. The problem for some may be that the labeling and wire colors on your old thermostat terminals may not match the new one. It helps to understand how thermostat systems work so you can be sure you are connecting it correctly. If you are not sure if you can do this, download the instruction manual from Lux and open up your old thermostat. If the installation wiring charts make sense and you are certain you identified all of your wires correctly, go ahead and buy this and install it yourself.\nThis is a small challenge to program, you need to read the instructions carefully. If you figured out the wiring, you can certainly get through the programming. Once you 'get it', its not that bad. There is a copy function to copy one day to another to speed things up. Keep the instructions handy because you won't remember how to reprogram it when you need to change the program. Speaking of instructions, it comes with a sheet, but you can download the full 30+ page manual.\nSome reviewers mentioned pulling the whole unit off the wall when opening the front panel. They are certainly putting their finger in the wrong spot. The design of the plastic housing does make it confusing the first time, but once you see the correct way, opening the front panel is effortless.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "212307", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

While the renovations were quite extensive and are discussed at times, the book also talks about the experience of living in rural France, relations with the neighbors, visits to nearby towns and festivals, their accumulation of various pets (cats, dogs, ducks, chickens, etc) and more. This is not the story of a wealthy couple living it up on the Continent, they were limited in funds. Not only did this restrict their choices in housing, I suspect it also means they were living and experiencing life more like their neighbors.\n\nMs. Marsh has a gift for writing and conveys scenes and situations so that it almost feels like being there with them.

At first I thought this book would be hard to get into. It took off in the prologue but then it went to eight years later and I wasn't sure what was happening. Once Derrick showed up and the story started coming out of Zoey I was shocked.\n\nZoey and Derrick have an all consuming relationship. He loves her and she loves him. He is hopefully going to be picked up by the NFL draft and she still had one more year of college left. They promised each other that things would not change. They would stay together and be getting married....nothing would change....right?\n\nI have to say I am sympathetic to Zoey's story more so than Derricks. Zoey (despite what it may seem) is a good strong person. She was broken down and built herself back up and was surviving.  I am glad that Derrick came back looking for her because I don't think she would have gone looking for him.\nFriends and family are great in this book. There is a strong tie between Suzi and Zoey but I am not sure what that comes from other than high school. Claire and Sasha are her sister and niece and they have family bonds between them and they seem to always be there for her.\nSometimes I felt like I was coming in in the middle of a story already going on and I was playing catchup. Other times everything was right on target with the rest of the story. I am curious about Claire and Jackson so looking forward to reading the next one.\nThis is a good story and one that had me speechless a couple times.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "212324", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

A young adolescent who carried out horrific torture and murder is an anomaly to me. I hear of young people planning and taking part in petty crime, but hellish victimization? Further, the brutal torture of young innocent children? I felt a curiosity to try and comprehend a human that had a malevolent dark side (if possible), and I wanted to understand how the detectives solved the case.\nFirstly, the author has a writing style that I'll call \"multi-tasking.\" Montillo does not just write about the main subject, which is Jesse Pomeroy. Several topics are explored, each of them are linked, some links are loose and some strong. The other topics are: the Great Boston Fire of 1872, geography and history of Boston, criminology in the mid to late 1800s, 19th century psychology, 19th century journalism, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Herman Melville, history of the insanity plea, and the serialized published crime story.

When holding Ridley Scott's foray into the world of the mob against most average films, \"American Gangster\" looks like a classic, but when compared to The Godfather, the crime films of Scorsese or even The Sopranos, this feature seems stuck in a pair of cement galoshes\n\n\"Gangster\" details the meteoric rise and fall of Frank Lucas (Washington), a 1970s narcotics drug lord from Harlem.  In what could be a lesson in an introductory business class, the film shows how Lucas was able to create a monopoly in the drug world by providing a better product at a lower price.  A true capitalist innovator, Lucas achieved his bargain basement prices by eliminated the dozen or so buffers between the opium fields and the street.  He flew to Southeast Asia himself, bought his product and had his family sell it on the street.  With no skimmers taking a piece at each port, truck depot, or airfield, Lucas built a company that crushed his competition.\n\nBecause of the skills of Denzel Washington, Lucas is both monstrous and human.  His work ethic, creativity and dedication paint the picture of a man who could have been the CEO of a major company had life dealt him different cards.  Instead, he built an empire described as more powerful that the mafia.  His counterpart (and equal in many ways) is Richie Roberts (Crowe) the unrelenting by-the-book New Jersey cop who brought him down.\n\nBy casting these titans as leads, Scott is able to camouflage many of his flaws.  Washington and Crowe both deliver what for other actors would be career-defining performances, but \"Gangster\" doesn't offer the total package of other crime stories.  It lacks the humor and cinematic artistry of Goodfellas and The Sopranos and fails to grasp the regalness of The Godfather.  The most creative element of the film is the Scorsese-like trailer with the retro sounds of Jay-Z`s  Heart of the City.  Many films would fail when compared to the best of the mob genre, so that does not mean \"American Gangster\" is without merit.  With two of America's finest actors at the top of their game and an irresistable story that brushes up against Vietnam, Ali and Nixon, the lack of creativity on the part of Ridley Scott is all that's keeping this from being one of the best films of the decade.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.54}, {"id": "212330", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

We have all heard the stories of his feuds with co-stars, failed TV shows, unique musical 'talents', and THAT HAIR!  Now, in one place, the Star Trek and William Shatner fan can find a reference to everything that is Shatner.  His detractors will find everything they want as well.  Mr. Schnakenberg does not pull punches with his A-to-Z chronicle of Shatner's life.  He delves into the ugliness of his disputes with fellow actors (most notably, James Doohan... aka 'Scotty') and his notable difficulty in his personal life (on his third marriage at the time of this book's release and now currently on his fourth following the tragic death of his third wife).  But, he is also fair in his depictions.  He goes to great lenghts to show caring and respect that both Shatner and Leonard Nimoy have for each other despite years of tension on the Star Trek set.  Not to mention exploring the positive value of his \"Rescue 911\" TV series.  Of course, there are also many humorous moments that are documented.  Shatner's foray into the music industry with 'interesting' \"The Transformed Man\" album (now a cult hit) is covered as is one of the funniest moments in Saturday Night Live history when Shatner, playing himself, tells the assorted weirdoes at a Star Trek convention to \"get a life!\".  Simply a fun read from beginning to end, the \"Encyclopedia Shatnerica\" is an cool addition to any person's library.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "212335", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

The heroine of this book is Summer's sister, Jillian (Jilly), and the hero is Taka's cousin Reno, newest operative for the Committee, and another ice-cold anti-hero, but not quite as gamma as Peter Bastien, from Book 1. Jilly is 20 and Reno about 28, I think (discrepancy with book 3), so they both seem less mature than the other couples in the series.\n\nThis book is set in winter in Tokyo, and also in Los Angeles. The Committee plays only a small role.\n\nWhen the story begins, Jilly has arrived in Tokyo unexpectedly, to cry on her sister's shoulder, hoping also to catch a glimpse of Reno, the exotic subject of all her secret virginal daydreams. However, danger waits for the unsuspecting brainiac. Because of Sir Harry Thomason's residual murder contract (see book 4), Russian mercenaries are trying to kill Taka and Summer, so they are hiding away. (We see little of Summer, but more of Taka.)\n\nSo, as a matter of family honor, Reno must keep Jilly safe from the thugs who would use her as bait to lure Taka back to Tokyo. And he must keep his hands off her, having promised Summer and Taka that he won't play into Jilly's infatuation for him. Keeping his hands off Jilly, resisting his attraction to her -- that's the central theme of this book. The suspense itself is a bit over-the-top, but heh...it worked. From Jilly's first day in Tokyo, the action is non stop, as Reno keeps his \"Ji-chan\" on the run from murderous Russian hit men, and even more treachery closer to home.\n\nThey spend every second together, even sleeping squeezed together in a tube hotel. Reno has promised to stay away from Jilly, and he has every intention of doing so, but ... easier said than done! He blows hot and cold, and sometimes terribly cold, attempting to stifle his intense feelings for her. He doesn't know what's wrong with him--he doesn't do love! Only sex.\n\nIf he can just get Jilly safely out of the country and back to LA, he could move on, and find someone else to screw. Right?\n\nOver the course of this story, Reno grows up a lot, facing some heavy family issues, falling in love, even getting rid of his exotic camouflage, to large extent, by the end of the book. I look forward to seeing him in book 6.\n\nI loved Jillian almost more than Reno, which is unusual for me. I usually bond with the hero more. Jilly held her own very nicely, and did what she had to do, even killing. Loved Reno's worried concern when Jilly went into a shocked daze after she shot someone's head off (a bit graphic, eeew). Jilly stayed strong and held it together even when Reno was a complete jerk, twisting the knife to break the growing emotional bond that scared him into a cold sweat. Loved the scene in Grandfather's compound, when Jilly realized how much Reno cared for her, despite his careless and cruel words. He says \"No, Ji-chan, I don't love you\" even as he's pulling her close, ready to die for her. Haha!\n\nAs I said, the non-stop action and never-ending danger is over the top, and when evil follows Jilly home to Los Angeles, I was rolling my eyes. But what fun!

Many of us who may feel relatively \"in touch\" with our feelings nevertheless are periodically reminded of how much work may still remain to be done. And so it is that \"Nothing's Wrong\" has appeared on the scene.\n\nAuthor Kundtz' approach is admirable on several different levels. He is male-affirming as a matter of course. Why shouldn't he be, since nothing is wrong with men! He implicitly accepts men's ways of communicating as valid and valuable. And he draws us into his viewpoints by telling personal stories (both about himself and about suitably anonymized patients of his). These tales enable us to draw links between our own selves and others, and help demystify and break down this whole sometimes imposing subject.\n\n\"Feeling from the gut\" is what many men do, Kundtz tells us, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that either. In a wonderfully simple yet deep metaphor, the author suggests that we must learn both to be the man on the moon (heroic, externally focused) and also the man in the moon (fun-loving, internally focused). The emotional miseducation of boys and men is explained in detail. One thing that had never occurred to me before: with the feeling world relatively closed off to most of us, men may love sports so devoutly (both as participants and spectators) because the game is one of the purest times we are able to feel alive. (And so it may be with me with my own lifelong interest in tournament chess.)\n\nProbably all of us have heard it said that feelings are neither good nor bad, they just are. But no one I can recall has so deeply illuminated this simple statement, showing us the \"premoral\" nature of emotions. (Morality--and responsibility--only enter into the equation when we decide whether or not and how to act on what we feel.) As a theologian, Kundtz is eminently qualified to discuss the terror most churches (and schools) seem to have regarding feelings.\n\nStay with \"negative\" feelings, the author urges us, at least for a while. Don't deny them. If a feeling doesn't get to tell us how to express it, it will be buried alive. Besides, unexpressed feelings inevitably will emerge on their own and potentially cause at least three different kinds of damage--addictions, physical illness, and emotional illness.\n\nThe author outlines three steps to emotional fitness. \"First: Notice the feelings. Stay with it. Second: Name the feeling. Pick a name to identify what you feel. Third: Express the feeling. Get the feeling outside you.\" One problem for men is often we don't even notice that we are having a feeling! Allowing ourselves to fully feel, for example, frustration, and then to name it gives us power, control, and time to process the emotion.\n\nKundtz' occasional missteps, such as his reiteration of the tired myth that domestic violence mostly happens to women, should not dissuade the reader from delving into this truly exceptional and unique volume. Best of all, at just over 150 modestly sized pages, the entire book can be finished within a couple hours or so.

I do agree with her. Of course sex is a valid topic since (whether your active or not) it is all around you. Unfortunately, even though Forever was the first book to write about sex for teens, it isn't overly well written, and it really misses its point.\nKatherine is the main character in the book. It's written from her point of view, and it is about the year-long relationship her senior year with Michael. Throughout the year, the two fall in love, she loses her virginity, and they vow to be together \"forever.\" That is, until she spends time around another guy and begins to wonder about \"forever\" with Michael. At that point in the story, it seems like Blume had actually reached a point where the characters (and the reader) could gain some type of insight. Maybe Katherine would realize that she was too immature for that relationship and too immature to face the consequences that go with a relationship? But Blume kills her one moment when Katherine goes on about not regreting anything she had done. Katherine had missed the point, as had Blume. Some of the characterizations in the novel were less than perfect, too. For instance, Michael is really suppossed to be in love with Katherine. The reader is told that but never sees it. All you ever see Michael doing is trying to have sex with Katherine. You never feel that he really cares for her, and that makes it even more ludicrous when Katherine doesn't regret anything.\nI'm giving Forever three stars on its importance to young adult literature. But really, as a work of art, it certainly deserves no more than two.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "212381", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Maybe some aren't but chances are most of us would find our curiosity piqued at some point. Who doesn't want to know where we go when we die? Who doesn't want confirmation of this...that we are loved and cared for even more after death than in life (and that's risky to say for those that see we live on a dysfunctional planet where spouses and family are the cause of great pain instead of real love). This books gives stories to confirm and acknowledge that there is life after death, and its relief that it exists with love.\n\nI like these points:\nWe live in a death phobic society\nThose who love us don't abandon us just because they leave this life\nQuote by Jack Lemmon: Death ends a life, not a relationship\nA Personal Goodbye story about a soulmate married couple\n\nThe field of questions/answers seems to be around the deceased and the happy heavens, and not enough around those left behind to know the deceased are equally interested in our well-being (which would do wonders for the grieving and if we had more tools for communicating with them). It's the ones we are sad about leaving us that we need to get our comfort from. Why not? What we hear instead is...they want you to be happy. (I hear a big buzzer go off in my head when I hear people say that nonsense). No, they are concerned for our well-being while here grieving for them. If my husband goes on a trip without me, having a grand ol time, and leaves me home alone while I'm sick, he sure better not say...be happy, dear - cuz I am! No, love dictates to call and make sure the other is ok and do whatever they can to help. Love isn't about self or being wooed by shiny objects (heaven). Love is about concern for the other person's well-being, 2 ways. Refer back to Jack Lemmon's quote above. I only wish the author went into this aspect a lot more.\n\nAuthor breaks up the different aspects of spirit experiences of life after life and from people in different religions. Author spends a lot of time on the death bed visions, giving plenty of stories and examples, she still goes into after death communications for a chapter. I wish that was expanded. The book has plenty of witness accounts and stories, titling them for easy snapshot reading. I expected a bit more analysis and conclusions about the deceased. But much of her information is to help confirm and acknowledge that these things do happen and are real, as the title implies.\n\nI didn't care for the chapter of going up against the skeptics. Irrelevant to me. I skimmed it. Frankly, I ignore skeptics because I know what I see with all my senses and critical thinking to eliminate possibilities for an answer - my deceased visiting me, leaving a sign. I'm sure many other experiencers will know that as well. I'm pretty sure the skeptics live to brush off what the rest of us know we saw, heard, smelled, witnessed. Buk lernin don't meen u no everythang. Wait until it happens to them. There's a difference between using good logical steps for rational conclusions and the skeptic mentality. This skeptic chapter was the reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nI like her conclusion chapter of how we can \"Learn to See the Unseen\". I'm always interested in 2-way communication with my loved one. That's what made the love between us grow - affections in agreement of sharing together. To expect me to be okay with sudden disconnect between us because of death just seems like a cruel set-up. I don't think it was meant to be this way, but something must have changed the mechanisms to make it difficult to continue. I'm always looking for a way around what I don't find as an acceptable reality. Tell me who isn't interested in contact with those we love dearly given the safe and fulfilling opportunity?\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "212383", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

However, Michael does have an impressively absent set of moral values - he's in it for the money. An impressively manipulative societal predator, he also understands how to make himself noticed or unnoticed, to get laid or to be ignored.\n\nHis predatory cunning and mercenary ethics all add up to one profession: a hitman.\n\nAnd he's very good at it.\n\nIn fact, Michael is so good at killing that he's been recruited by a mysterious group called \"The Choir\" to do a series of hits. The prize is immense, but they're high-profile and, more importantly, messy. The dead? They keep coming back.\n\nSpurrier's style - something akin to Bret Easton Ellis' - is incredibly disconcerting. The reader is bombarded with paragraphs of Aztec gods, shopping lists, Internet trivia and instructions for building a silencer. Most of Contract is from Michael's point of view, but the occasional snippet of diary entry from his confidante Sally is enough to show us that he's a) unreliable and b) not nearly as cool as he thinks he is. The purpose of the book seems to be to pose as many questions as possible about the narrator's perceptions and then, largely, shrug them off.\n\nContract isn't an easy read. Michael is a collapsing, predatory, macho narrator who generates little sympathy - and, aside from a few clever witticisms, Contract lacks the goofy, self-awareness of The Culled. Contract is not over the top - which makes it all the more disturbing.\n\nInteresting, Contract is redeemed at the end. The sense of an Epic Supernatural Plot is largely ignored for the more human drama of Michael quest for purpose. Underneath all the layers of hallucination and distorted perception, Spurrier cleverly weaves everything together, culminating in an excellent final \"reveal\" and brilliantly-executed ending. Contract is a book about a side character, a \"disposable\" (as Michael would say) in the great scheme.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "212393", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I promised myself I wouldnt buy another book at the time, but I kept coming back to it. Finally I was able to snag it at the library.\n\nIn 1936, Albert Ellingham built an elite private school (but tuition-free!) in Vermont for children of all ages to practice their own interests, to engage in puzzles, read books, and really explore the world around them. Being a fun of mazes and riddles, the campus is also home to a multitude of hidden nooks and crannies. However, she and Iris, her mother, were kidnapped and held for ransom. Iriss body was recovered a few weeks later, but not Alices. The only clue left behind was a mocking riddle from Truly Devious, a pseudonym.\n\nDecades later, Stevie Bell has arrived on campus and is eager to solve the crime. Fancying herself an amateur sleuth, she believes that she has found the missing link to clear the alleged killers name and bring the real one to justice. Then, its onto the FBI, where her real life can begin. Before she can crack open the old case, however, she has to adjust to being away from home, learn how to make friends, and manage her anxiety.\n\nI thought Stevie was a good character. She was strong and embraced her differences, but not at the expense of belittling females who are interested in make-up or being a cheerleader  which is also what her conservative, traditional parents want her to be. I didn't care too much about the other characters. I didn't think we spent enough time with them to really gauge their personalities, and I wished that we were shown more of Janelle and Stevies friendship. Good female friendships are hard to come by!\n\nMy issue was also with pacing. The book is set across two timelines: 1936 and present day, with a murder mystery in each one. The problem was, we didn't get to the murder in the present day period until halfway through the book. I felt like in that regard, it took too long for the story to get started.\n\nI find myself thinking and re-thinking about the end. I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know, it was hard for me to really get into the book and then to come to the end so abruptly.. I guess thats why Im not sure if I liked liked the book.\nScore:"}], "output": "3 \n", "formatted_output": "3", "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "212398", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

[OOOPS: at the end of June 2013, Amazon removed customer-uploaded images from product pages. Sometimes that even included the cover of the book. Sorry.]\n\nIf it weren't for this pioneer of needlework authors who first compiled ALL forms of needlework into this one volume, needlework publishing--and our stitching--would not be where it is today.  Please don't fault her for poor images or only b&w pictures in her books: she wrote this book in 1886.\n\nTherese de Dillmont was born in Austria in 1846 and died in 1890.  Early on, she started working for Dolfus-Meig et Cie in France which is our current DMC (the only floss and pearl cotton I use).  She set about perfecting every form of sewing, crochet, knitting, tapestry, goldwork, macrame, and applique she could.  She specialized in all forms of hand embroidery on cotton and linen including open work, filet and other laces.  She accumulated examples of sewing and handwork and as she reproduced them, she invented many stitches herself.\n\nShe wrote this huge definitive tome in 1886 and it has been revised and edited routinely since then; it has been translated into 17 languages. Every single stitch dictionary and encyclopedia owes a huge debt of gratitude to her because they all hearken to her work.  Any later author of such compendia worth her salt pays tribute to Ms. Dillmont.\n\nSo if you don't like the complicated stitch discussions or find it difficult to make out the drawings, remember what a primitive state illustration and publication were in the 19th century.  If you are a beginner, you can pick up some stitches in some area or other of needlework.  If you're at least an intermediate,  you can take some of the images and make the stitches your own: incorporate them into your next project.\n\nFor utility, however, I strongly recommend these books for learning stitches:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stitch-Dictionary/dp/1405348208/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stitch Dictionary</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stitch-Sampler-The-Ultimate-Visual-Dictionary-to-Over-200-Classic-Stitches/dp/0789446286/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stitch Sampler: The Ultimate Visual Dictionary to Over 200 Classic Stitches</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-New-Dictionary-of-Counted-Thread-Embroidery-Stitches/dp/0517886634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The New Dictionary of Counted-Thread Embroidery Stitches</a>\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "212402", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Schiff does a lot of myth-busting in this book:  Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek, not Egyptian; she probably didn't die of an asp bite; and she was a far more intelligent, capable leader than she is usually given credit for.  I will let historians and Egyptologists opine as to the thoroughness of Schiff's research and the validity of the conclusions she reaches, but it seems as though she has trawled through numerous ancient texts and records to support her theories about Cleopatra's life. (The biggest criticism I have of the book is that it is densely written, with so many references to source material, commentary about said source material, and long, complex sentences intertwining on themselves, that one sometimes gets bogged down in verbiage and too much detail.) Indeed, one of the biggest challenges facing a biographer of an ancient figure like Cleopatra is the lack of first-hand source material.  When contemporaneous, primary sources don't survive, the biographer has to turn to secondary sources, many of which were written to satisfy political or other agenda, and Schiff does a good job of pointing out the difficulties in relying on these sources as she goes along.\n\nIn all this talk about sources and history, I don't want to overlook the fact that Cleopatra lived a fascinating and dramatic life,which Schiff does portray admirably (if her writing style is a bit on the dry side at times).  Cleopatra came from a long line of monarchs, and had to fight hard to obtain and keep her crown.  Schiff talks about the familial conflicts, sibling pitted against sibling, that explain why Cleopatra, like so many other Egyptian monarchs, ordered so many assassinations to secure her throne.  There are, of course, Cleopatra's relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, each of which seemed to be based both on the personal charms of the men but also on Cleopatra's need to maintain an alliance with Rome to further stabilize her hold on the Egyptian throne.  And Cleopatra's fabulous wealth and luxurious lifestyle is fascinating to read about; bowers strewn knee-deep in roses, golden barges with purple sails, lavish entertaining... it's a window into a rare and truly over-the-top way of life.\n\nDespite all of the soapy details, what stayed with me the most were the more lasting, one might say feminist, qualities that Cleopatra displayed.  She received a thorough education, the best available at the time, and was very intelligent and learned.  She spoke multiple languages fluently, no joke when you consider the different and difficult-to-learn tongues spoke in that region, and thinking about the beautiful queen able to converse as easily with slaves as with fellow rulers and ambassadors is a striking image.  She was a political survivor, using what she had to first get her throne, then keep it, while expanding her reign over large parts of the Mediterranean/Middle East.  She faced rampant sexism from many quarters, particularly from Romans who did not have a particularly enlightened view of a woman's role (and it was interesting to learn how enlightened Alexandria was regarding women's rights by comparison).  So many historians and commentators have written Cleopatra off as a sexual predator, judging her far more harshly than the men she had relationships with (Caesar and Antony were certainly no virtuous husbands faithful to their wives!) that I enjoyed reading Schiff's more objective portrayal of Cleopatra as an intelligent, ambitious, perservering ruler who, yes, probably used her sexuality as a part of her arsenal, but who should be viewed as so much more than a limpid babe in eyeliner, lying on a barge, or a scheming slut who slept her way to the top.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "212413", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

That being said, there were a few notes or scene points that you don't see in the movie that are written in the screenplay but they don't divulge any important secrets - in fact some of the descriptions are incredibly vague.

Wilde's gift for wit is, even now, unsurpassed, and for all the liberties taken with this film, it's wonderful to see that so much of the original wit and dialogue has remained intact.\nThe film takes place in London in 1895.  At issue is the habit some women had of idolizing their husbands--of putting them on pedestals and creating ideals out of them, with their love being directly proportional to the perceived perfection of their husbands.  The problems inherent in such a relationship are obvious; for one thing, as the film highlights, the higher a man has been raised, the harder he can expect to fall.\nThe film revolves around Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam), a Member of Parliament and \"ideal husband,\" and his seemingly faultless wife, Gertrude (Cate Blanchett).  But Sir Robert is not, of course, an \"ideal.\"  Sad to say, he is a mere mortal with feet of clay whose very marriage depends upon his wife as she discovers her husband's imperfection, her own imperfection, and whether or not she can love a man who is a mere flawed mortal.\nI don't wish to give the story away.  Suffice it to say, it is absolutely delightful and (for the most part) consummately acted.  Although the story revolves around the Chilterns, the central character is really Lord Goring (Rupert Everett), a very content, witty, idle, and carefree bachelor whose time has come to marry, or so his father Lord Caversham has decided.\nFor those familiar with the play, I must emphasise that this is a film.  It is not a film of the play.  Not being restricted, therefore, in place and time as live theatre is, justifiable liberties have been taken to create something visually appealing and exciting in a way that Wilde could never have conceived possible.  A wealth of different settings have been utilised (rather than just three), and events that were merely alluded to in the play have been dramatised (by flashback in one instance).  Though much of the dialogue is (thankfully) verbatim, it has been trimmed back here and there and occasionally has not been placed where it occurs in the play.  The gravest liberty, however, has been to remove the part wherein one of the characters uses a brooch as a bargaining chip with a certain blackmailer.  Instead the film has these two characters reaching a different arrangement, one which relies upon the outcome of a particular Parliamentary speech.  Whether justifiable or not, I did find that this alteration extended the suspense and added an additional (and quite entertaining) reason for interest in the outcome of the speech, and it was certainly a plausible arrangement in view of the proposal the blackmailer had first made.\nWhether or not one is an Oscar Wilde purist, this is a film to be enjoyed, for it is a treasure indeed to find a show that is at heart a comedy which does not descend into silliness.  At a time when most films are geared towards adolescents (or those with like mentalities), this film is a refreshing, delicious treat--a witty and wonderful feast for the intellect.  Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the wit of Oscar Wilde, period productions, or to anyone who is simply looking for an intelligent, entertaining and thoroughly satisfying comedy.  It's definitely not one to be missed!\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "212479", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I bought this book to introduce me to the subject and to help me make informed choices of what to drink on a one-month trip to Belgium and the Netherlands.  I am at home now, and I can report that Webb's information made a good tour itinerary into a special life experience for me. I reserved for meals at some of the restaurants he most highly recommends and I visited equally fine pubs I would not have found without his guidance. The information he provides in each of his entries is so good that I think a range of drinkers and diners will be able to find some place or some beverage that is very close to their personal interest.\n\nThis book goes farther than ale:  it has the best short essay I have found (after a lot of looking) on Belgian food, places to stay and historic and cultural sights as well as the expected focus on beer tourism.  Beers/ales are rated on a one to five scale and flavors are described, there is a focus on independent brewers (the ones that spend more money on ingredients and take more time to \"get it right\") but mass-market brewers are not neglected.  Art work shows Belgium at its scenic best and focuses on each beer/ale served in its eye-catching special glass and stored in its colorfully labelled bottle.  All photography is high quality, as is Tim Webb's writing.\n\nI am not a beer fanatic but I am a fan of CAMRA, their philosophy of what makes \"real ale\" and of their guide books.  Last year's month in England  was much-improved by their guide to British real ale and the pubs that serve it.  I found great food, great drink and great architecture with its help.  Belgium presents beer differently than does England:  the emphasis here is not on pub culture and pubs.  The brewers and their products are front and center in this book and web addresses are included so one can find each brewery's take on its own products and one can find US importers, should one want to order some exceptional brews.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "212483", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Charles is worried by the state of the building, knowing immediately that it must be haunted. When Charles tries to sleep in his bedroom for the first time, he discovers he is right and there is something in his closet. Luckily, a neighbor gives him a card for Margo Maloo, Monster Mediator. Charles considers himself a journalist and wants to interview Margo, but she is having none of it though she lets him join her in negotiating with the troll who lives in the basement. Charles finds himself in a parallel world to his own, where there are trolls, goblins, ogres and many more monsters than he could ever have dreamed.\n\nWeings graphic novel tosses readers into a new world that is strongly based in our own. With Margo as an expert guide, this book is much less about battling monsters. It is more about how monsters can get along and live alongside humans in a urban setting. Weing has created a complete monster society and ensures with his stories that the monsters are not the bad guys, just easily misunderstood. The writing is clever, the dialogue solid and the pacing is fast.\n\nThe art of the graphic novel is modern and filled with plenty of action. The city and characters are filled with diversity that includes humans and monsters in different skin tones. Weing uses the real estate of his panels in smart ways, lengthening them to share more scenic detail, focusing the scope closely when necessary and broadening them for large buildings.\n\nJust the right book for Halloween, expect this and future books to be popular thanks to a wise mix of humor and shivers. Appropriate for ages 8-11.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "212491", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

Say what you will about PFS the book recommendation was well worth the read.  When I did it the first time I changed my life.  However, I didn't keep with it and eventually I lost ground that I had gained as a result of reading this book.  Now I'm going through it again and I've put it on my calendar to review each year to keep moving myself forward.  John C. Maxwell is a great leader and speaker.  I've learned many things from him and like Brain Tracy says, 'Learn it once and keep applying it.'\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "212495", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

I enjoyed seeing the two reconnect. Brando has always had a thing for Kaitlin and when he runs into her while he is on vacation he is not letting her go this time.  He longs for something more than just friendship with her. I loved watching their friendship grow and turn into love. I cannot leave out the interaction between Brando and Kaitlins brothers. I just couldn't get enough of them.  It was nice to see some familiar faces from the Santini clan as well. There is so much love and devotion in these characters you cannot help but love them.\n\nI am enjoying this series and I can never get enough of the Santinis. As always I enjoyed returning to the world of the Santinis. This is another fast paced and enjoyable read with great characters full of depth and emotions.  I am eager to see just who will get their story told next.\n\nI received this book in exchange for an honest review.\nScore:"}], "output": "5 \n", "formatted_output": "5", "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "212498", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

And amazingly, in a very short span of time. As a child of the 50s & 60s, \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\" will always stay in my heart. This was a huge part of my childhood Christmas tradition year after year.\n\nI couldn't quite give this recording any higher rating than four stars though, due to the reproductive quality of the old mono sound. But I would still recommend it for the most part. Probably not the program I grew up on, since this is the original from the very early 50s; I was born in 1955. But the power of this story and the superb music written as an opera, probably the best ever composed for television, will delight anyone familiar with this work. And I'm sure many others will be won over as new listeners.\n\nThere are said to be many local stage productions of this classic annually, but I've only had the pleasure of seeing it once live on stage, and that was the early 70s, put on by my high school drama and music departments. There was even a newer production shot in Israel in the late 70s, but I didn't enjoy that much higher budgeted effort anywhere near as much as the earlier version I remember, or this recording from the original cast done back in 1952. The newer version just didn't have the same emotion or magic. So much for location scenery.\n\nAt this time, I await with great anticipation, the black-and-white DVD offered here on Amazon that I recently ordered. They also offer the newer 70s version, but I wasn't interested. Be forewarned though, the very dramatic ending will bring many to tears, especially from \"All That Gold\" to \"Oh, Woman, You Can Keep The Gold.\" A television classic.\nScore:"}], "output": "4 \n", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "212499", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the review.

When read slowly and thoughtfully, with time to sit back and mull over the sometimes bewildering and often-quoted but seldom understood quotations from the book of Ecclesiastes and Gibsons illuminating comments, this book is very rewarding. There are questions for further reflection, too, which I used and appreciated. What a marvel to understand these concepts at my oldish age; I wonder if I would have believed and grasped them when very young... Gibson writes so well. I cant begin to distill the wisdom conveyed as he has done a great job of making every chapter count.
